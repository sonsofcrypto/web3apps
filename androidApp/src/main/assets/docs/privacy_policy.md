We are stong believers in [cypherpunk's](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt) ideals. 
Indeed it is one of reasons why web3 wallet exists. There is
no analytics framework, no collections of data of any kind. 
Any data needed for functioning of the app is only ever stored
on your device. We do not operate any servers. App interacts 
with various chains directly. Not via web2 service. 

Temporary execption is Pokt.network as RPC until Ethereum 
restores LES functionality. Moralis is temporary used for 
detecting NFTs. Until chain only service is developed in 
couple of weeks.
