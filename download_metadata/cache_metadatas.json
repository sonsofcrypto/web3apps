ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nEthereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. Smart contract is essentially a computer code that runs exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nEthereum allows programmers to run complete-turing smart contracts that is capable of any customizations. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to have complete control over customization of their smart contract, giving developers the power to build unique and innovative applications.\r\n\r\nEthereum being the first blockchain based smart contract platform, they have gained much popularity, resulting in new competitors fighting for market share.

The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called \u201cstable coins.\u201d Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or \u201ctether\u201d the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] \u201c100% backed by USD\u201d (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can\u2019t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account."}, "usd-coin": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/large/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389", "rank": 4, "colors": ["#2479CC", "#B5CFEC"], "link": "https://www.circle.com/en/usdc", "description": "USDC is a fully collateralized US dollar stablecoin.

However, instead of playing on a 2-dimensional screen, you participate in a 3-dimensional world. It seems to be the logical next step before creating full-blown AI-based games in the physical space \u00e0 la Westworld. Similar groupings on LAND comprise Districts. Districts are basically communities that revolve around a shared theme. For example, there may be a District just for crypto enthusiasts with cryptocurrency apps and services.\r\n\r\nThe Decentraland team is led by Ari Meilich (Project Lead) and Esteban Ordano (Tech Lead). Ordano previously worked at <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/\">Bitpay</a> as a software engineer and founded Smart Contract Solutions, Inc. Both founders have also worked together in creating Stremium and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcore\">Bitcore</a>. Decentraland has been around for longer than you may think. The team hit their first development milestone, Stone Age, in June 2015. This was a simple, pixelated grid that allocated pixels to users through a proof-of-work algorithm. Most recently, they held a Terraform Event in which they sold LAND in the new, 3D world. The team has also partnered with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x\">district0x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon\">Aragon</a>, and imToken to provide some of their services. \r\n\r\nMANA is the token used to buy lands in Decentraland.

An unclaimed land would have the same market pricing on every exchange possible and precisely the developers are on a hunt for such since as they can build on top of it, and attract lot of popularity. However, one must keep in mind that the land parcels are different from them and each one of them varies according to the various market conditions of that time.

Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker\u2019s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward \u2013 it\u2019s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It\u2019s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker\u2019s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It\u2019s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don\u2019t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price."}, "havven": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3406/large/SNX.png?1598631139", "rank": 69, "colors": ["#0F033B", "#14054F"], "link": "https://www.synthetix.io/", "description": "Synthetix is based in Australia, Synthetix launched a seed funding round in September, 2017 to develop the concept of a self-contained stablecoin payment network.

The project was founded by Kain Warwick, who previously co-founded blueshyft, one of the largest digital payment networks in Australia. The CTO is Justin Moses, who also serves as the Director of Engineering at MongoDB. Synthetix aims to address the problem that companies running centralized payment networks such as PayPal, credit card networks, or the SWIFT banking network have \u201cabsolute control over the value within the network, so any transaction conducted within them may be blocked or reversed at any time.\u201d According to the Synthetix white paper, \u201cAlthough this is ostensibly designed to protect users, it introduces systemic risk for all participants. If the network is compromised or its owners cease to behave benevolently, no party can trust that the value in their account is secure or accessible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is theorized to work because anyone who holds SNX tokens in escrow will be incentivized by Synthetix rewards derived from network transaction fees that will be distributed \u201cin proportion with how well each issuer maintains the correct Synths supply.\u201d When a Synthetix escrow user puts their SNX in escrow, USD-stabilized Synths will be automatically put up for sale on a decentralized exchange at a price of $1 USD. To release escrowed SNX, the user must buy back the Synths issued (also at a price of $1 USD) at which point the Synths will be burned. The Synthetix system uses an algorithm to adjust network fees, and therefore dividends, to SNX holders to incentivize (or disincentivize) the holding of SNX in escrow smart contracts, and thus, the creation of Synths. The theory is that this will cause users to mint and burn Synths in the appropriate amount based solely on supply and demand."}, "paxos-standard": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6013/large/Pax_Dollar.png?1629877204", "rank": 70, "colors": ["#2BBA4C", "#66B582"], "link": "https://www.paxos.com/standard/", "description": "Pax Dollar (USDP) was created by Paxos, a financial technology company on a mission to modernize finance by mobilizing assets at the speed of the internet. Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos describes itself as \u201cthe first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise\u201d, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It\u2019s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/okex\">OKEx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gate\">Gate.io</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/zb\">ZB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin\">KuCoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/digifinex\">DigiFinex</a>.

He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.

The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binancecoin\">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>. The creation of BNB secured Binance\u2019s place as the world\u2019s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\r\n\r\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, \u201cnot an ICO,\u201d due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi\u2019s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That\u2019s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation.

The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that\u2019s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc\u2026) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.\r\n\r\nEnjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform \u2013 over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it\u2019s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They\u2019ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.\r\n\r\nEnjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list. Enjin Coin is an ambitious project that aims to integrate online virtual gaming with decentralized technologies.

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\r\n\r\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\r\n\r\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain\u2019s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\r\n\r\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThe developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there\u2019s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.\r\n\r\nArthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80\u2019s and have been working on Holu since before the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company\u2019s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy.

In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way.

LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work.

And, by substantially lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual users (\"requestors\") to rent resources of other users\u2019 (\"providers\") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Today, such resources are supplied by centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Also core to Golem\u2019s built-in feature set is a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">Ethereum-based</a> transaction system, which enables direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.\r\n\r\n\u25cf The function of Golem as the backbone of a decentralized market for computing power can be considered both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), as well as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, Golem reveals its true potential by adding dedicated software integrations to the equation. Any interested party is free to create and deploy software to the Golem network by publishing it to the Application Registry. Together with the Transaction Framework, developers can also extend and customize the payment mechanism resulting in unique mechanisms for monetizing software.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/golem-gnt/\">CoinBureau</a> for the full review of Golem."}, "sushi": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12271/large/512x512_Logo_no_chop.png?1606986688", "rank": 149, "colors": ["#A477B6", "#F8F4F9"], "link": "https://sushi.com/", "description": "Sushi is a DeFi protocol that is completely community-driven, serving up delicious interest for your held crypto assets.\r\n\r\nOn Sushi, you can take advantage of passive-income providing DeFi tools such as liquidity providing, yield farming and staking.

Polymath streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that the industry lacked security-specific standards, Polymath spearheaded the creation of a unified standard for security tokens on Ethereum, ERC 1400. ERC 1400 acts as an umbrella of standards and is designed to address some of the challenges in managing security tokens by enabling the ability to conserve UBO rights for custodied assets, and automate transfer control (including KYC verification) and corporate actions (including capital distribution or voting). \r\n\r\nPolymath has brought forward many advanced innovations that address regulatory and market needs head-on. They have built a series of tools on the chain that offer non-technical users an intuitive means to access the chain\u2019s functionality, and are also in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built for security tokens and the first specialized chain of this nature. Security tokens have the ability to alter the financial landscape, unlocking trillions of dollars in asset value and investment, programmably automating operations, and driving new paths to liquidity - but there are significant barriers standing in the way of institutional adoption. The foundations of Polymesh are focused on the most crucial regulatory elements addressed by four key design principles meant to meet the demands of regulators and institutions. Those four principles are Identity, Compliance, Confidentiality, and Governance. When put together, these four pillars can also support complex operations, such as settlement. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to creating and managing digital securities, Polymesh\u2019s specificity gives it, and the applications built on it, a distinct advantage over those leveraging general-purpose blockchains. The purpose-built infrastructure addresses the gaps in standard blockchain architecture to align the functioning of the blockchain with the requirements of modern capital markets. By combining Polymesh\u2019s deep functionality with user-friendly tools, Polymath stands to transform capital markets.\r\n\r\nAll transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token. POLY is the utility token that fuels Polymath Token Studio on Ethereum and is used by issuers creating and managing security tokens on the platform.

Kyber\u2019s liquidity hub architecture allows developers and the Kyber team to rapidly innovate and integrate new protocols into the overall Kyber Network to cater to different liquidity needs.\r\n\r\nIn April 2021, Kyber launched the Kyber DMM, the world\u2019s first dynamic market maker protocol (DMM). Kyber DMM is a next-generation AMM designed to react to market conditions to optimise fees, maximise earnings, and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers, especially for stable pairs with low variability in price range (like USDC/USDT, ETH/SETH). They will be able to support pools with extremely high amplification factors, which means given the same liquidity pool and trade size, slippage can be 100x (or more) better than typical AMMs. Depending on their amplification strategy, liquidity providers can maximise the use of their capital and have the opportunity to earn much more fees relative to their contribution size, while takers can enjoy extremely low slippage on their trades.\r\n\r\nKyber DMM is the first of many new liquidity protocols that will be launched on the Kyber 3.0 Liquidity Hub.\r\n\r\nIn the Kyber ecosystem, KNC token holders play an important role in deciding new growth and value-capture opportunities and incentive mechanisms. Through KyberDAO, KNC holders can participate in the governance of the network by voting on important proposals. Kyber\u2019s community is sizable and made up of a wide range of developers, in addition to other members of the blossoming DeFi industry.\r\n\r\nKyber\u2019s fully on-chain design enables the protocol to maintain full transparency and verifiability. The platform claims to be the most used liquidity hub in the world.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Kyber Network Secured?\r\nAs an ERC-20 token, Kyber is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, Kyber uses an extensive trust and security model that protects users from misbehaving administrators or exchanges, thanks to security measures built in both at the protocol and smart contract level.\r\n\r\nThe platform has been audited by several third-party security firms and researchers, including Chainsecurity, which have determined that the protocol is secure and hence free of vulnerabilities."}, "mxc": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4604/large/mxc.png?1655534336", "rank": 204, "colors": ["#5F06F6", "#B331A2"], "link": "https://www.mxc.org", "description": "The MXC vision is to introduce a systematic process to both simplify and increase IoT data transactions\r\n\r\nThe decentralized infrastructure upon which MXC\u2019s system is based is the future of Low Power Wide Access Network (LPWAN) and the Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol). Utilizing this solid device network foundation, MXC is introducing an extraordinarily unique coin offering, Machine eXchange Coin (MXC), which allows for increased data transactions and an idiosyncratic data flow monetization within the mammoth data market. \r\n\r\nMXProtocol places a keen focus on reducing collision between networks, constructing an inter-chain data market, developing a market for network coverage and introducing an independent Quality of Services (QoS) framework for both data providers and receivers.

Launched in 2017, Bancor was the first DeFi protocol.\r\nToday, it generates millions in fees per month for depositors, offering up to 60% APR on tokens like ETH, WBTC, LINK, MATIC, AAVE & more. Bancor is owned by its community as a decentralized autonomous organization (Bancor DAO).\r\nThe protocol token used on the network is the \u201cBancor Network Token,\u201d BNT. The protocol\u2019s token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Anyone can contribute liquidity to the pools. When liquidity providers contribute liquidity to a pool, they are eligible to receive fees for trades that pass through the pool. Liquidity providers will receive pool tokens that represent their share of liquidity, fees, and Liquidity Mining rewards in the pool.\r\n\r\nHow Many Bancor (BNT) Coins Are In Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe Bancor Network Token (BNT) has an elastic supply, afforded by the protocol's minting and burning of tokens to maintain trading liquidity levels in Bancor pools. Protocol-owned trading liquidity earns swap fees from trading volume, such that the protocol comes to hold more BNT over time. The protocol's new balance of BNT is then burned in exchange for pool tokens when LPs stake the equivalent amount of their own BNT. Due to swap fees earned, more BNT is ultimately burned than was initially supplied by the protocol. This excess of BNT is then burned to offset the cost of impermanent loss, deflating the overall supply of BNT in the long term.\r\n\r\nHow Is The Bancor Network Secured?\r\n\r\nBancor is one of the longest-running and most heavily audited projects in crypto, receiving stellar ratings from leading auditors including Certik, PeckShield, and Halborn.

POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger\u2019s team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. They\u2019re comprised of six Board of Directors in addition to over ten full time-team members. Power Leger\u2019s five co-founders make up five of the six Board of Director seats of the company. The sixth board seat belongs to venture capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist. Tai\u2019s experience is quite extensive; he is currently the Chairman of Treasure Data and also a Board Member of Bitfury and Boxer.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger\u2019s POWR Presale sold out in just three days and raised over thirteen million dollars (AUD) in exchange for 190,000,000 tokens. After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining 160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and concept further.

Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\r\n\r\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain\u2019s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec\u2019s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP \u201cimplements all the needed features\u201d to make this possible on a global scale, including \u201cfault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.\u201d Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\r\n\r\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project\u2019s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec.

While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it\u2019s not a storage platform; it\u2019s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">Golem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">SONM</a>. Both of these, however, are taking aim at a different animal.

The Request Network itself is an Ethereum-based decentralized payment system where anyone can request a payment and receive money through secure means. It removes the requirement for third parties in order to provide a cheaper, more secure payment solution that works with all global currencies.\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates a request for payment, they define to which address the payment needs to be allocated and what the amount is. The user can also define the terms and conditions of the payment, upgrading a simple request into an invoice. Once this is completed, the user can share their request to be paid by their counterparty.\r\n\r\nEvery step is documented and stored on the Request network, allowing everyone involved to easily keep track of all the invoices and payments for accounting purposes.\r\n\r\nRequest is also integrated with legislation across the world to remain compliant with the trade laws of each individual country.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Request?\r\nThe founders of Request are Christophe Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur.\r\n\r\nChristophe Lassuyt is currently the chief financial officer at Request. Before this position, he co-founded MONEYTIS.\r\n\r\nEtienne Tatur is the chief technical officer of Request. Prior to this, he also co-founded MONEYTIS and worked as a lead developer at QOBUZ, a music streaming service.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Request Unique?\r\nThe payments on Request are performed by simply sending an invoice through the blockchain; the counterparty can then detect the request and pay it with one click in a peer-to-peer manner. The fact that the payments are push-generated instead of pull-generated is one of Request\u2019s key advantages. There is no need for users to share their account information. The use of blockchain technology also eliminates the need for third-party processors, resulting in a reduction in transaction costs.\r\n\r\nThe Request Network leverages decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum and IPFS for an increased level of security, privacy and data ownership for the end-user. The platform does have transaction fees, which is a cost that is required to broadcast a change to the blockchain network. The transaction fees are used to incentivize miners to reach consensus on the state of the network.\r\n\r\nREQ can be stored on wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, Ledger, imToken, Trezor, Atomic Wallet, Jaxx Liberty and Trust Wallet.\r\n\r\nHow Many Request (REQ) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\nREQ is an ERC-20 token that can be spent to use the Request Network.\r\n\r\nA portion of the REQ fee is burned at a rate that is determined by the current supply and the exchange rate with other currencies.\r\n\r\nRequest\u2019s (REQ) circulating supply is at 999,912,165 REQ as of February 2021 and the maximum supply is 999,983,984 tokens.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Request Network Secured?\r\nREQ is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum platform. The requests made with REQ are stored on an immutable digital ledger.

One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network\u2019s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain\u2019s decentralized nature.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards\u2019 blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Quarkchain are:\r\n\r\n1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.\r\n\r\n2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.\r\n\r\n3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.\r\n\r\n4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.\r\n\r\n5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain.

Safecoin will serve as the currency for the SAFE network, a network made up of the extra hard disk space, processing power, and data connectivity of its users. Think of it as the sharing economy but for your digital resources. MaidSafe is the company developing the SAFE network to save the world from the perils of centralized data storage. In the current paradigm, the best case is corporations use your data to better target you to their advertisers. The worst case is they leak your private data to the public, as Yahoo, Equifax, Target, and many other companies have already done.\r\n\r\nThe SAFE network ultimately wants to \u201ccreate a secure, autonomous, data-centric, peer-to-peer network as an alternative to the current server-centric model.\u201d There will be two main users of the network: clients and farmers. The client accesses the various features of the network, such as browsing, storing data, or transferring money. The farmers store and look after your data until it\u2019s needed, at which point they might receive a reward for their efforts. The SAFE network is an \u201cencrypted layer that sits on top of the current internet, allowing for autonomous data storage and networking by replacing three\u201d of the OSI networking layers.\r\n\r\nMaidSafe, a Scotland based company, started developing the SAFE network in 2006. The presale on April 22nd, 2014 sold 10% of all MaidSafeCoins. You could buy 17,000 MaidSafeCoins for 1 BTC at that time.

The Aragon project is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that\u2019s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an organization on the blockchain. \r\n\r\nIn the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve, scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors. It also doesn\u2019t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don\u2019t get it twisted, the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a \u201cBest Underage European Programmer\u201d award, and he\u2019s a recipient of Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 recognition. He\u2019s a young guy, but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\r\n\r\nAragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company or organization requires. It\u2019s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned on and off, providing instant customization for the company\u2019s needs. In addition, all of the code behind Aragon is open source. A company\u2019s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company\u2019s requirements. \r\n\r\nThe modular design of Aragon doesn\u2019t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies can edit existing modules, they\u2019re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon, combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction. Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn\u2019t operate based on country boundaries. Instead, it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.\r\n\r\nThe ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive structure of the platform. It represents the wealth of the decentralized economy and was initially sold during Aragon\u2019s highly successful ICO in May 2017 that raised $24 million. Subsequently, the ANT token has come to represent a powerful share of the governance on the platform. ANT holders can vote on proposals, participate in arbitration and the decentralized court system, and help contribute to the non-profit Aragon Foundation or to research and development through the Aragon Nest program."}, "fetch-ai": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5681/large/Fetch.jpg?1572098136", "rank": 344, "colors": ["#1E2944", "#242D49"], "link": "https://fetch.ai/", "description": "Fetch.ai is delivering AI to the crypto economy.

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there\u2019s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let\u2019s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that\u2019s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He\u2019s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018."}, "deapcoin": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10970/large/DEAPcoin_01.png?1586741677", "rank": 421, "colors": ["#D68F09", "#E8A422"], "link": "https://dea.sg/", "description": "The entertaining platform \u201cPlayMining\u201d allows users to acquire the cryptocurrency through enjoying games and cartoons that are available for free on the platform; simultaneously, the roles and goods within will be sold as the cryptocurrency, and used for second transaction among users through Digital Art Auction, which adopts ERC721 private blockchain to manage securely users cryptocurrency.

These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> as the base cryptocoin. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale=en\">Trezor Hardware Wallet</a> are also wallets that supports district0x.\r\n\r\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders\u2019 rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs."}, "lto-network": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6068/large/lto.png?1638855565", "rank": 511, "colors": ["#7F39BA", "#4A76C7"], "link": "https://www.ltonetwork.com/", "description": "LTO Network is a blockchain platform for creating decentralized workflow applications, while maintaining data privacy and GDPR compliance.

Aave also uniquely allows a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn\u2019t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a \u2018My Loan\u2019 section, collectible badges and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange. \r\n"}, "presearch": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1299/large/presearch.png?1548331942", "rank": 520, "colors": ["#2D8EFE", "#AAD1FE"], "link": "https://www.presearch.io/", "description": "Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform.

With our new ERC-31337 token wrapper, Rootkit is able to unlock the ETH from under the price floor and send it to a vault. This ETH is moved without effecting the market price, or depth of the order book. As the price floor rises through market volume, liquidity locks. Which means more ETH is unlocked from below the floor and sent to the vault. Because there is no tokens available to sell, the floor starts at the price, which is determined by how many ETH are raised in the ETH. Since we can unback the KETH below the floor, all of the ETH used to create the first liquidity can be used twice. This lets us offer our first LP a huge bonus, which is something no other protocol can do.

PoS token holders can deposit their tokens onto the pSTAKE platform to mint 1:1 pegged ERC-20 wrapped unstaked tokens represented as pTOKENs (e.g., pATOM). Users can convert pTOKENs into 1:1 wrapped ERC-20 staked representatives called stkTOKENs by staking the underlying deposited PoS tokens. stkTOKENs, representing staked tokens, accrue staking rewards in the form of pTOKENs (This mirrors the workings of most PoS chains where staking rewards aren't automatically compounded but earned in the form of liquid tokens which can be claimed by a user at any point in time).\r\n\r\npSTAKE allows its users to utilize stkTOKENs in various DeFi protocols to earn additional yield on top of their staking rewards.\r\n\r\nExample: Alice wraps (deposits) 100 ATOM on pSTAKE. She receives 100 pATOM representing 100 ATOM deposited onto the pSTAKE platform. As long Alice has 100 pATOM, she can redeem 100 ATOM (1:1) from the platform back into her Cosmos wallet by burning off her pATOM balance (This is the unwrapping process).\r\n\r\nAfter receiving 100 pATOM, she decides to stake the underlying deposit of 100 ATOM on the Cosmos Hub to earn staking rewards (assume ~7% Annually). On staking, Alice receives 100 stkATOM, and her pATOM balance is now changed to 0 (pATOM burned, stkATOM minted). Let's assume there's an already existing stkATOM-ETH liquidity pool on SushiSwap. Alice supplies all her stkATOM and an equivalent amount of ETH into the Sushi pool to become a liquidity provider (LP). A portion of the trading fees generated on SushiSwap is distributed to all the LPs (Assume that this results in 9% yields annually). Thus, if Alice doesn't face any Impermanent loss at the end of the year, she would earn (7+9)% yield on her 100 ATOM holdings instead of the usual 7% she would have received by simply staking (and not liquid staking). Alice, being a PoS coin staker, leverages pSTAKE's technology to generate additional yield.\""}, "victoria-vr": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/21178/large/vr.png?1638496975", "rank": 583, "colors": ["#FFDE03", "#FFD56C"], "link": "https://victoriavr.com/", "description": "Victoria VR is the first blockchain-based MMORPG in virtual reality with realistic graphics built on the Unreal Engine, created and owned by its users.

SelfKey is a self-sovereign identity system that is based on the blockchain and can provide control and management of digital identities to users. Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management systems. These include the lack of accessibility to financial services and the tedious KYC processes that are paper based.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of SelfKey is the self-hosted data storage. This lets you secure your identity documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems. The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY, and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey. \r\n\r\nOn his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose \u201cskill sets lie at the crossroads of finance, technology, and law/regulations.\u201d Additionally, he has been involved with other projects related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed ledgers.

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD\u200a\u2014\u200aevery Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\r\n\r\n*Features of Dai:\r\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\r\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\r\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\r\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\r\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\r\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\r\n\r\n*How Dai Works?\r\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal\u200a\u2014\u200aa token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\r\n\r\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1\u200a\u2014\u200ait is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into \u201cwrapped ETH\u201d (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This \u201ctokenizes\u201d ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into \u201cpooled ETH\u201d (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin\u200a\u2014\u200ayou lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so\u200a\u2014\u200amargin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created."}, "spookyswap": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15223/large/logo_200x200.png?1621992076", "rank": 591, "colors": ["#464557", "#9B89AC"], "link": "https://spooky.fi/", "description": "SpookySwap is the token for an automated market-making (AMM) decentalized exchange (DEX) on the Fantom Opera network."}, "shiba-predator": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24430/large/l1KzMcL.png?1647660619", "rank": 592, "colors": ["#5D5080", "#F0652B"], "link": "http://qompredator.finance", "description": "QOM is the Shiba Predator, it is a community token whose function is to flip the Shiba Market cap.

Trusted layer 1 validator network built on the Tendermint protocol - Wasm compatibility, for smart contracts to be deployed on CUDOS using next-generation languages so long as they compile to WebAssembly. I.e. Golang, Rust, Java etc.\r\n\r\n2. Cross-chain or Horizontal interoperability thanks to the network\u2019s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) integration, allowing Cudos Network smart contracts to interface with multiple networks.\r\n\r\n3. 10x lower transaction and gas costs compared to those on PoW networks - A massively scalable network to facilitate more sophisticated smart contract operations\r\n\r\n4. Higher performance with anywhere between 200 to 500 Peak TPS on the network - access to a globally distributed layer 3 network of secure cloud, and compute, resources\r\n\r\nTuring complete solutions for non-Turing complete Layer 1 blockchain networks. With the underlying Cudo platform live in over 145 countries, across enterprise and edge environments, and used by over 250,000 users, CUDOS is the next major release, providing a decentralised computing layer bridging on-chain and off-chain resources.\r\n\r\nThe CUDOS token serves the following clear purposes: Transaction payments, Network governance and operations, a staking mechanism for receiving blockchain and cloud workloads, and a medium of exchange (MoE). \r\n\r\nWhat is CUDOS trying to solve? \r\nScaling on blockchain is both expensive and limited in the type of use-cases it can support. CUDOS solves this issue by providing a highly scalable Layer 2 and 3 solution, connecting both on-chain and off-chain consumers to the network via smart contracts and APIs. \r\n\r\nWho are the founders at CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS was founded by Mathew Hawkins, an award-winning entrepreneur, who previously founded C4L, a data center, cloud and network infrastructure provider that grew to support 1% of the UK\u2019s internet infrastructure. Exiting in 2016 for $30m, Mathew started Cudo and the CUDOS network to build infrastructure services in software, what he previously achieved in hardware. The executive team have backgrounds in building and scaling and SaaS with COO Lee Woodham, who has over 25 years split across scaling financial services and tech companies. The board of advisors also includes David Juxon, former MD of Bank of America, Chris Deering, Former President of Sony Entertainment (Playstation), Joerg Roskowetz, Director of Blockchain for AMD and Maggie Fang, early investor in Uber and Alibaba. \r\n\r\nWhat makes CUDOS unique? \r\nCUDOS is the first decentralised computing network to provide services to both on-chain and off-chain infrastructure consumers. Built on the Cosmos blockchain and utilising the Tendermint protocol for secure BFT consensus, the CUDOS validator network will provide a globally distributed and highly secure network able to allocate more intensive workloads out to the underlying Layer 3 Cudo platform. \r\n\r\nHow is the CUDOS network secured? \r\nThe CUDOS Network utilises the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Bonded Proof of Stake mechanism featured in the Cosmos SDK, known as Tendermint Core, as its consensus engine. Validators in the CUDOS network stake a given amount of CUDOS in order to earn fees from validating transactions on the network in a secure and highly reliable way. In order to achieve this, the CUDOS Network also leverages the Cosmos SDK\u2019s staking, slashing, and governance modules to incentivise a minimum of 95% uptime and to swiftly eliminate validators known to perform double-signs or other known forms of bad actor behaviours. \r\n\r\nWho are the major partners of CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS is partnered with major and recognised brands across both blockchain and enterprise computing verticals, including AMD, Ultra & Algorand. Strategic backers include Outlier Ventures (OV), Moonwhale, Moonrock, Brilliance Ventures, GBV, Spincrypto, Double Peak, Coinvision, and BMW Capital. \r\n\r\nHow many CUDOS coins are there in circulation?\r\nThere is a maximum supply of 10 billion CUDOS tokens released over a 10 year period (starting from the 11th January 2021). The total supply of 10 billion CUDOS is distributed via multiple allocations, with 34% Ecosystem & Community Development, 33.78% Reserve, 20% Team (2% released based per milestone achieved. 10 key pre-determined milestones), 5% Advisors and 7.22% to presale token holders. Use of funds will be as follows: 30% Research & Product Development, 10% Administration & Operations, 20% marketing, 10% CUDOS Validator Nodes (CVN), 13% User Acquisition, 10% Community Engagement and 7% Contingency. \r\n\r\nWhere can you buy CUDOS?\r\nAt the time of writing, the top exchanges for CUDOS trading are Ascendex, KuCoin, Gate.io, Uniswap, Bittrex Poloniex, CoinField, Liquid, ZT Global, and others."}, "token-pocket": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7603/large/pocket.jpg?1658907018", "rank": 609, "colors": ["#339DE9", "#88ACE6"], "link": "https://www.tokenpocket.pro/", "description": "TPT stands for TokenPocket Token.

A blockchain platform, like QANplatform is the basic infrastructure of all blockchain projects and applications. It is like the operating system on a computer. The whole ecosystem can only build and work on top of it. Connect it with real-world data, run automated smart contracts, build decentralized applications (DApps). According to HFS Research excerpt for IBM: Enterprise blockchain adoption is going through a \u201c90-9-1\u201d adoption challenge. 90% of companies are still trying to internalize the concept and its relevant impact. 9% of enterprises that identified relevant use cases are struggling to start with their PoCs and pilots. The 1% of enterprises that have successful pilots are challenged with scalability to a production-grade environment. To achieve blockchain mass adoption Qanplatform focused on these challenges. They built a lot of automation and integration to help freelance developers, blockchain development companies and enterprises start their blockchain PoCs (Proof-of-Concept) as fast as possible. It takes less than 5 minutes to deploy the QAN private blockchain to a preferred cloud platform and start building on it. \r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of QANplatform ? \r\n\r\nJohann Polecsak, QAN's Chief Technology Officer is also an economist. He along with the Business Development team pursues the way to make QAN as appealing as possible. In the end all what matters is market share. His laser focus lights in the single direction of eliminating any obstacles which could come up as a reason not to implement Blockchain technology, making QAN the only sane choice to work with. Endre Abraham (Silur), QAN's Head of Cryptology contributed to several blockchain projects like Ethereum, Zcash, or Monero. Gaining such an extensive experience could only lead him in one direction: Building a blockchain which solves the pain points of the existing mainstream ones.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes QANplatform Unique? \r\n\r\nQANplatform solves the problems enterprises and developers face when using currently available blockchain by building a platform from scratch that does not require them to make compromises:\r\n\r\n    - Hybrid blockchain platform\r\n    - 80% faster implementation than other blockchains\r\n    - Lowest hardware and energy requirements on the market\r\n    - Predictable data transaction prices for public blockchains\r\n    - Enterprise-ready transaction speed\r\n    - Quantum-resistant security \r\n\r\nThe experienced team behind QANplatform worked in companies and projects like IBM, Telekom, Uber, Bitcoin.com, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash..."}, "ooki": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/21719/large/Ooki.png?1640699416", "rank": 612, "colors": ["#CC7AA7", "#FFA553"], "link": "https://hello.ooki.com"}, "zipmex-token": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13866/large/ZMT_Token.png?1637241562", "rank": 614, "colors": ["#0E0D0E", "#111111"], "link": "https://trade.zipmex.com/trade/BTCUSD", "description": "ZMT is a ERC-20 token custodised on BitGo created and governed by Zipmex, a digital assets exchange and investment platform.

Creators of the NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network\u2019s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it\u2019s a grand-slam idea.\r\n\r\nPundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000 NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000 and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across social media and online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.\r\n\r\nThe company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.\r\n\r\nPundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they\u2019re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance behind their efforts.\""}, "the-virtua-kolect": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13330/large/virtua_original.png?1656043619", "rank": 667, "colors": ["#640AE7", "#8F4DEE"], "link": "https://virtua.com/", "description": "Virtua is a gamified metaverse which provides immersive social, web3 gaming, digital collectible and interactive experiences."}, "solve-care": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1768/large/Solve.Token_logo_200_200_wiyhout_BG.png?1575869846", "rank": 669, "colors": ["#22235B", "#E35328"], "link": "https://solve.care/", "description": "What Is Solve.Care (SOLVE)?\r\n\r\nSolve.Care is a healthcare platform company that uses blockchain to redefine care coordination, improves access to care, reduces benefit administration costs, and helps reduce fraud and waste in healthcare around the world. \r\n\r\nThe Solve.Care platform allows for digital health networks, called Care Networks, to be built and run for patient-centric care based on medical conditions, economic and social needs, and other tailored eligibility criteria, creating an entire healthcare ecosystem. Using the Solve.Care platform, businesses are able to launch networked, interoperable healthcare dApps, within only weeks or even days.  \r\n\r\nCare Networks on the Solve.Care platform use the SOLVE token, a utility token that is used for inter/intra network payments and transaction fees. It also has additional uses including developer rights, staking, marketplace payments, and platform access fees. \r\n\r\nWho is the Founder of Solve.Care?\r\n\r\nPradeep Goel, the Founder and CEO of Solve.Care, has extensive expertise in healthcare, finance and technology. Prior to Solve.Care, he had been in the CEO, COO, CIO and CTO roles at various innovative technology companies over 25 years\r\n\r\nPradeep was deeply involved in designing and building solutions for public programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, children health insurance and welfare programs, SNAP/TANF, health insurance exchanges and health information exchanges. He has worked for and with commercial insurance companies as the top technology executive, and implemented benefits administration, consumer engagement, claimed medication and payment systems. \r\n\r\nPradeep has built 4 healthcare IT companies and has been at the top of Deloitte\u2019s Technology Fast 500, INC500/5000 fastest growing companies lists multiple times. Pradeep was included in the 100 most promising entrepreneurs globally, complied by Goldman Sachs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Solve.Care Unique?\r\n\r\nThe Solve.Care platform leverages blockchain and full stack capabilities to deliver significant business value to individuals and enterprises. These business values include ease of usage, privacy, security, control and ownership of data, interoperability, auditability, and enhanced trust between parties.\r\n\r\nSolve.Care gives healthcare stakeholders a unique opportunity to build their own dApps to form Care Networks, connecting and synchronizing their participants, making instant payments inside their network, and sharing information immediately to reduce opportunities for fraud. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is unique because it not only allows networks to run independently, but to also have a fabric underneath that allows them to all communicate.\r\n\r\nAll Care Networks are fully and intrinsically tokenized to manage events, identities, transactions, payments and data sharing using the SOLVE token, which is a combination of transaction fee payment token (like Ethereum as gas), as well as a normal payment currency. The SOLVE token also has a unique property of being able to function inside the Network, either as a variable value token or as a fixed value token (as a stable coin). This property makes it uniquely powerful and appropriate for healthcare usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolve.Care has built blockchain healthcare networks for the real-world clients such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Uber Health, Lyft, Aon, Arizona Care Network and others. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is the first company in the world to successfully deploy digital currency and blockchain technology for value-based payments in US healthcare.

The Distributed Control Right Management is a security layer that protects all locked-in cryptocurrency assets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures that no one can have access the complete private key, meaning that no single node can gain control of the digital assets. Along with the traditional transaction triggering mechanism, FUSION incorporated time and event based triggers into its smart contracts. These three triggering modes have resulted from various financial situations, and have been designed to meet the requests of complex financial smart contracts.\r\n\r\nBitSE, the company behind the Fusion Project, was founded in 2013 by Dejun Qian, being also responsible for the creation of QTUM and VeChain. QTUM and VeChain are both blockchain foundations which developed into independent ventures. The native token of the Fusion platform, FSN, will be used in paying network fees. Smart contracts require FSN in order for them to be executed, much like how ETH is used in the Ethereum network.

Liquid is a global cryptocurrency firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the greatest liquidity possible.\r\n\r\nThe Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section. With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.\r\n\r\nQASH is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">ERC20</a> token you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts, promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar to how some financial institutions use the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">Ripple XRP token</a>. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous other businesses like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> specializing in alternative coins or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini\">Gemini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gdax\">Coinbase</a> focusing on fiat to crypto conversions. \r\n\r\n Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was previously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho Asia. Lozada was the CTO of Merrill Lynch in Japan for 11 years before taking the Chief Information Officer role at Credit Suisse Japan. Quoine is the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA). The Liquid platform is actually the result of combining two previous platforms, Quoinex and Qryptos.

It is a system that rewards users who engage in \u201csocial mining\u201d. Mithril rewards users for the impact their content may have in viewers and the popularity it attracts, such as number of likes and views.  In the blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Mithril is a very innovative idea that aims to change the way we think about social media entirely. This particular innovation will decentralize and reward social media content creators in a fair and open way.The process of building a social media platform from the scratch is a long, rigorous and exhausting one. Even though blockchain based social media platforms are not new innovations, they usually cannot interact with existing platforms. The Mithril integration protocol permits MITH mining on all social media networks. Therefore, Mithril can also leverage existing sites for their own purposes. In addition, it permits content influencers to make use of their pre-existing followers network to mine Mithril. This acts as a big plus to the Mithril ecosystem. It requires less stress and work than establishing followers on an entirely new platform. It also helps Mithril to have an edge and a bigger pool of users. This means that, content providers only need to start making use of the Mithril integration protocol in order to make more money.\r\n\r\nInstead of an ICO, Mithril held a private crowdsale where 400,000,000 MITH was distributed and 50,000,000 was retained by the Mithril team for development and marketing. Mithril MITH tokens are mined by participating on partner applications and this social mining is a gamechanger. Creating and sharing content earns Mithril MITH, which can then be spent with partner applications. Because mythril is a crafting ingredient in the Final Fantasy video game series, online searches for how to spend MITH have these pages mixed in, which will likely continue for several years until the platform gains enough big-name retail spending partners to rise up SEO rankings.\r\n\r\nMITH is currently available on Bithumb and OKEx, but more exchanges will likely list the token soon. Although exchanges are never the best place to store your cryptocurrencies due to security concerns, this is one possibility. Better would be to store them using an ERC-20 wallet that allows you to add custom tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-mycrypto-desktop-app?locale=en\">MyCrypto</a>, or Coinfy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mithril platform and its flagship social network Lit are still in fairly early development, as an early mover, they are poised to be a leader in the decentralized social networking space. If Mithril gets its way, centralized social networking companies may soon have worthy competitors that offer users more control of their data while rewarding people for creating the content that is ultimately the life-blood of all social networks."}, "ultiledger": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6747/large/Ultiledger.jpeg?1547042996", "rank": 761, "colors": ["#3FB7CB", "#7FDDEB"], "link": "https://www.ultiledger.io/", "description": "Ultiledger aims to apply blockchain technology to build a distributed financial database and account system at a low cost.

It is responsible for inventing proof-of-stake consensus, which makes it the first efficient and sustainable public blockchain technology. Peercoin was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a>, and it shares much of the source code and technical implementation of bitcoin. The Peercoin source code is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license. Unlike bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/namecoin\">Namecoin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, Peercoin does not have a hard limit on the number of possible coins, but is designed to eventually attain an annual inflation rate of 1%. There is a deflationary aspect to Peercoin as the transaction fee of 0.01 PPC/kb paid to the network is destroyed. This feature, along with increased energy efficiency, aim to allow for greater long-term scalability.\r\n\r\nWith the same cryptographic hash function as Bitcoin (SHA-256), Peercoin is 100 times more energy efficient. Transactions in the Peercoin network are faster and cheaper. If there were not fierce competition on the cryptocurrency market, Peercoin would probably have long since become one of the most important cryptocurrencies. But in 2014 and 2015, however, there were many other interesting innovations in the cryptocurrency market that outperformed peercoin in a number of important properties. In contrast to DASH, Peercoin could not offer anonymity and the transactions in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a> were even faster and cheaper than those of Peercoin. PoS technology ceased to be an advantage of peercoin and PoS continued to spread to other cryptocurrencies. The interest of the users drew it to the side of the minings on the CPUs and GPUs, then to the side of the Smart Contracts and PPC began to get a little forgotten. \r\n\r\nThe Peercoin Team believes that adapting blockchains for wide scale use only through on-chain transactions will negatively affect the decentralization level and security of the network over time, therefore we choose to develop the Peercoin blockchain as a base layer settlement network with a sole focus on securing all forms of value recorded into the chain. This can be accomplished through Peercoin's philosophy of preserving and maximizing decentralization (which increases security) by developing the majority of features and technologies on top of the blockchain, rather than directly into the blockchain protocol itself.\r\n\r\nThus the Peercoin Team focuses on developing second layer protocols and sub-networks that can interact with the base layer blockchain to adapt it for wide scale use and improve functionality such as tokens, smart contracts and high speed low cost transaction processing. In this way, Peercoin will act as a secure and censorship resistant base layer for the future blockchain connected world."}, "cellframe": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14465/large/cellframe-coingecko.png?1644483414", "rank": 878, "colors": ["#040107", "#584FAB"], "link": "https://cellframe.net", "description": "Cellframe is a quantum-resistant layer-1 network focused on facilitating secure and scalable cross-chain transfers.

We also provide some of the lowest trading and withdrawal fees on the market.\r\nThe PointPay crypto wallet provides a way to store digital assets on the blockchain, easily send them via email, and track their value over time.\r\nOur payment system allows customers to buy the most popular digital assets directly from debit and credit cards for fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, etc.\r\nThe PointPay blockchain-based bank allows users to earn interest on 13 of the most popular digital assets, including stablecoins USDT, USDC, and DAI, by simply funding Checking or Savings accounts. We offer a transparent and simple interest rate that allows anyone to earn up to 8% APY on their assets.\r\nFurthermore, users can stake PXP tokens to earn up to 20% per year on their PXP token holdings. With just a few clicks, our customers can lock their holdings for 3, 6, or 12 months to earn rewards on a progressive scale - the more tokens they invest, the higher the reward will be at the end of the period.\r\nCrypto banks allow anyone to apply for a loan and receive funding within minutes. PointPay customers can lend seven popular cryptocurrencies with USDT as collateral. Crypto loans typically do not require a credit check because digital assets serve as collateral for transactions.\r\nWe believe that the future of banking will be built on blockchain technology. PointPay is excited to be at the forefront of the crypto banking revolution, providing a platform with the broadest range of crypto banking services in-house. Our goal is to enable financial freedom by offering universally accessible crypto banking services. \r\n"}, "foam-protocol": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3345/large/K51lJQc.png?1547037959", "rank": 886, "colors": ["#6E5453", "#775856"], "link": "https://www.foam.space/", "description": "FOAM is an open protocol for proof of location on Ethereum. Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM\u2019s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes\u2019 clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this \u2018Dynamic Proof of Location\u2019 is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace\u2019s control."}, "the-doge-nft": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18111/large/Doge.png?1630696110", "rank": 888, "colors": ["#B18741", "#D3B062"], "link": "https://ownthedoge.com/", "description": "The most iconic meme in internet history, the original Doge, is now fractionalized and available for anyone to own.

It is created by the combination of technologies of RFID and blockchain, which push forwards the integration of block chain and the Internet of Things.\r\n\r\nWaltonchain combines blockchain with IoT (specifically RFID) to create a management system for supply chains. The project is named after Charlie Walton, the inventor of RFID technology and a pioneer in the space. Logistics systems are complex and commonly involve several different parties. As these systems grow, it becomes increasingly tough for businesses in the same vertical to coordinate with each other. On top of that, individual entities may have different processes that further hinder the ability to transfer data back and forth. Waltonchain uses RFID identification to track products during each step of production and distribution. \r\n\r\nThe data associated with each item is stored on an immutable blockchain that ensures its accuracy no matter where in the process it is.The Waltonchain team is loaded with supply chain experience. Do Sanghyuk, one of the co-founders, was previously the Director of the Korean Standard Products Association. The other co-founder, Xu Fangcheng was the Supply Chain Management Director of Septwolves Group Ltd. The team is getting support from their Chief Scientist Advisor, Kim Sukku \u2013 a former vice president of Samsung. Waltonchain has no shortage of partnerships \u2013 several of which are with Chinese provincial governments. The team is working with the Fujian government to create a \u201csmart maritime\u201d blockchain incubator, and with the Jinhu government to build smart air purification and monitoring systems.\r\n\r\nThe Waltonchain architecture makes use of a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake & Trust (PoST). Waltonchain innovates on the traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) model and integrates a node reputation based system into the consensus mechanism. PoST provides for adjustable difficulty for each node, to ensure that integrity in the ecosystem is rewarded. Waltonchain also gives sub-chain developers the option to choose their own consensus mechanism, for example, sub-chains can strictly just have PoS as a consensus mechanism, and not PoST. Waltonchain, by use of its RFID technology, has introduced a novel way with which blockchain can solve not only the inefficiencies found with supply chain management, but also IoT.

Furthermore, such a system should have deep, long-term, and protocol-owned liquidity to reduce friction and maintain tight pegs. It is our belief that creating such a system brings us one step closer to creating a more peaceful and prosperous future for mankind. The first step in building such a system is to re-think 'money' based on the following principles:\r\nOn-chain and decentralized: Reduce custodial risk. This stands in direct contrast to centralized stable coins that may have significant custodial risk.\r\nValue-stable: Frictionless trade requires using money whose value does not significantly fluctuate. Value stable is a relative term. For example, depending on the use case, the best money should be designed to be stable relative to national currencies (Such as USD or Euro), a basket of currencies, an inflation adjusted currency, in-game virtual currencies, reward points (imagine a stable coin that traces a hotel or airline point system on chain) etc. The Spice Trade platform allows building appropriate on-chain decentralized money for all these use cases.  \r\nScalable: Money is a tool of trade. The last thing a successful trade network needs is friction in scaling its monetary system. \r\nModular: As we will demonstrate in the rest of this whitepaper, the Spice Trade protocol is fully modular to accommodate both immediately predicted needs as well future unknown use cases.\r\nOpen-Source: Creating an open-source ecosystem where anyone with a good idea can contribute and build on top of the Spice Trade protocol is one of our core values\r\nCapital-Efficient: While over-collateralized on-chain stable coins pioneered the non-custodial money movement, we believe they will play a relatively smaller role in the future of money. Let us present the following hypothetical scenario in the real-world economy to demonstrate the point: Imagine we remove all the currencies in the world. Then, in order to generate any new fiat dollar (so that trade can resume), someone has to take a mortgage against their physical assets, and only then money is generated to enter the circulation. This would create such a tight monetary system that any real world economy would come to a screeching halt and collapse. And recent market trends reflects the above reasoning as well. Over-collateralized on-chain stable coins are falling further behind in market cap rankings relative to both centralized and on-chain algo-stable stable coins due to capital inefficiency.\r\nCross-Chain: History has shown that technology continuously evolves and improves upon itself. And any product, community, or nation that does not evolve with it will ultimately get left behind. As such, we strongly believe that any successful decentralized product that wants to withstand the test of time needs to be a meta concept that stays above any particular blockchain (or blockchain technology) and can easily be extended and expanded from one chain to another. For example, while Proof-of-Stake seems to be the current king of consensus-building algorithms, who knows what the future might bring. Why build a chain based on today's technology and trap your protocol in it, when we know that the blockchain of the future may look significantly different than that of today?  \r\nProtocol-Owned Liquidity based on Starfish Topology: As discussed in future sections, the Spice Trade protocol is designed to have significant liquidity with practically zero cost by building on the concept of Starfish Topology (pioneered by RadioShack: https://docs.radioshack.org/radioshack-defi/terms/disclaimer)\r\n\r\nSpice Trade is the first protocol to encapsulate all of the above principles into a suite of value-stable products.

Data Consumers can trust the authenticity of the data they purchase, \u201cNurseries\u201d (Data Producers) are compensated fairly every time their data is used, and \u201cPioneers\u201d (Data Vendors) have the incentive to create innovative Constellations. This new transparent ecosystem ensures that companies get the authentic data they need.\r\n\r\nWhere Quadrant has major potential for impact is the ability it provides \u201cElons\u201d (the brightest data minds) to find linkages between different constellations and, in turn, create mega Constellations that can be used by Data Consumers to solve real-world problems. This is where Quadrant differentiates itself from its competitors.\r\n\r\nQuadrant is designed to work with both centralised and decentralised services. The architecture consists of the core Quadrant blockchain, clients (Data Producer, Data Consumer and Anchor), and Guardian Nodes. Quadrant will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism so that it can handle more transactions, operate at a lower gas price, achieve faster transactions, and restrict malicious nodes from entering data into the network. An external Proof of Work chain will be used as an anchor for security purposes. For the time being, the Ethereum blockchain will be used for anchoring but it can be replaced by any public chain in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nQuadrant will utilise two different currencies for its network: eQuad and QUAD. QUAD, a utility token, is designed to be used solely on the network. It will be used to stamp data, support simple and complex access structures, simple and complex subscription payments, and for staking by Elons. eQuad is an ERC-20-compliant token that will be sold during the Token Generation Event (TGE).

Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee. \r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a \u201ccard\u201d. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\r\n\r\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today\u2019s centralized platforms. It\u2019s an \u201cexperience layer\u201d for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps.

DeFi Yield Protocol: Your New On-The-Go DeFi\r\n\r\nDeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) will provide a solution to the risk Yield Farming brought in. How? \u2013 The DYP is developing a platform that allows anyone to provide liquidity and to be rewarded for the first time with Ethereum. At the same time, the platform maintains both token price stability as well as secure and simplified for end users by integrating a DYP anti-manipulation feature.\r\n\r\nHow will this work?\r\n\r\nDeFi Yield protocol (DYP) is changing the way you earn through liquidity on Ethereum smart contract. The argument is that whales have the power to control the network. DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) prevents the whale advantage. DYP anti-manipulation feature ensures that all pool (DYP/ETH, DYP/USDC, DYP/USDT, and DYP/WBTC POOL) rewards are automatically converted from DYP to ETH at 00:00 UTC, and the system automatically distributes the rewards to the liquidity providers. This feature is excellent because the network\u2019s liquidity will be fair to all participants; no whale will be able to manipulate the price of DYP to their advantage.\r\n\r\nEvery day at 00:00 UTC, the smart contract will automatically try to convert the DYP rewards to ETH. If the DYP price is affected by more than -2.5%, then the maximum DYP amount that does not affect the price will be swapped to ETH, with the remaining amount distributed in the next day\u2019s rewards. After seven days, if there are still undistributed DYP rewards, the DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) governance will vote on whether the remaining DYP will be distributed to the token holders or burned (all burned tokens are removed from circulation).\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are the engine room of any related project. The advantage of smart contracts is that the community writes the rules; they can work without human interaction. Unlike the centralized world in which a set of rules are interpreted by a few experts who make decisions. Cool feature, Right. Not really. There is a significant disadvantage of smart contract risk, which happens when there is a bug in a smart contract. YAM finance is the greatest example of a smart contract risk. The team discovered a bug that prevented a vote from being executed. Yam tokens were dumped by users causing the tokens to plunge overnight. DYP prevents smart contract risk by ensuring that all their smart contracts are audited, and the codes are secured from participants who try to take advantage of the system."}, "bitnautic": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2875/large/Logobit.jpg?1547037044", "rank": 1154, "colors": ["#102458", "#737D98"], "link": "https://bitnautic.com/", "description": "BitNautic is a decentralized platform, based on the Ethereum Blockchain, for matching demand and supply of shipping services, for all the industry stakeholders: producers of goods, ship owners, charterers, brokers, importers and exporters.\r\n\r\nBitNautic comes with distinctive features like AI (Artificial Intelligence) based booking system, a real-time tracking of ships and cargo, and a wholesale e-commerce platform."}, "gamee": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14716/large/gmee-200x200.png?1621827468", "rank": 1157, "colors": ["#554FF9", "#4493F2"], "link": "https://www.gamee.com/", "description": "GAMEE is a high-engagement gaming platform, where users complete game missions, compete in tournaments and earn prizes for their activity.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to create an entertainment platform accessible to anyone, connecting gamers and game creators to recognize and reward gaming skill, effort and loyalty."}, "skey-network": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13425/large/SKEY_Network_logo_black.png?1633421778", "rank": 1158, "colors": ["#1F173E", "#714AEA"], "link": "https://skey.network/", "description": "Skey Network aims to connect the physical with blockchain database via a \"Blockchain or Things\" bridge."}, "sonm": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/861/large/sonm.png?1548609871", "rank": 1160, "colors": ["#6B747A", "#C0C4C6"], "link": "https://sonm.io/", "description": "SONM is a global operating system that is also a decentralized worldwide fog supercomputer.

According to the Populous website, \"invoice finance is a form of funding that instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to offer funds to invoice sellers, Populous maintains a Liquidity Pool. This is tied in with the Populous cryptocurrency (PPT). An investor securitizes PPT by making an initial purchase. PPT is then held in escrow as collateral throughout the process. Transactions between invoice buyers and sellers take place with Pokens, exchanged for PPT and used as the currency for buying and selling invoices, either drawing from or contributing to the Liquidity Pool in the process. As a result of this built-in liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries, including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.\r\n\r\nThe PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing, you\u2019re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it\u2019s the lesser of 50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice.

This vision has yet to be widely developed in the blockchain space, and thus is largely bottlenecked by the lack of interoperability, and this is exactly why we are introducing New Order.\r\nNew Order is an Ecosystem DAO that is built to operate as a launchpad for the most innovative Web3 financial products, tools and applications that contribute to the vision of creating a fully composable financial ecosystem embracing multi-chain DeFi at its core. The DAO will support early stage projects aligned with its vision of being chain-agnostic, focused on a plethora of innovative new-age asset classes including data-driven tokens, NFT's and more. The primary goal is to create an ecosystem that is not bottlenecked by limiting interoperability and allow liquidity to freely enter markets and foster growth in the biggest financial ecosystem in DeFi."}, "adora-token": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/17713/large/Adora-200px-200px_rostsy.png?1629083234", "rank": 1273, "colors": ["#FBC787", "#FEFCFA"], "link": "https://adora.finance/", "description": "Adora is a group of projects that run and connect with businesses and services around the world.

The project was launched on October 5, 2018 and is one of the pioneer cryptocurrency startups in the Philippines. The project aims to fast track mainstream adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency through an ecosystem of practical products and services.\r\n\r\nSparkPoint started with an initial funding of $50,000. With only this minimal capital combined with discipline, determination, and hard work, the team was able to launch various blockchain-based products and services including SparkPoint Wallet, SparkLearn, SparkPlay, SparkEarn, and SparkDeFi. These products and services have collectively reached hundreds of thousands of users and are steadily growing.\r\n\r\nThe SparkPoint Ecosystem is composed of:\r\n\r\nSparkPoint Wallet\r\n\r\nNon-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet that natively supports various cryptocurrencies including SparkPoint (SRK), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and other ERC-20 tokens. It also offers built-in Decentralized Exchanges including Uniswap, ChangeNOW, and Changelly. A virtual currency exchange (VCE) license application is ongoing to legally enable fiat integration in the SparkPoint Wallet. \r\n\r\nSparkLearn\r\n\r\nE-learning platform focused on educational content about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and financial literacy. The platform currently offers free courses for these topics and is continuously being improved through UI/UX enhancements, onboarding of new mentors, and integrating a Learn-to-Earn model. Education is at the heart of SparkPoint. \r\n\r\nSparkPlay\r\n\r\nCollection of mobile casual games with cryptocurrency as central theme. Currently available games include Crypto Slicer, Crypto Burst, and Crypto Shooter. Tournaments and achievement bounties are being conducted regularly as part of SparkPlay\u2019s Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming model. P2E is an emerging paradigm in gaming where a significant chunk of value goes to players. Using blockchain technology, players are empowered to truly own game items and earn cryptocurrency rewards.\r\n\r\nSparkEarn\r\n\r\nSparkPoint referral and rewards program where users can earn SRK and other tokens from sponsors by performing simple bounties. SparkEarn accounts are also currently being used as a single sign-on (SSO) account for SparkLearn and future SparkPoint services including SparkPlay and SparkDeFi.\r\n\r\nSparkDeFi\r\n\r\nA governance token-based platform that empowers individuals to unlock the true value of their cryptocurrency assets. SparkDeFi offers an AMM Decentralized Exchange, Liquidity and Pool-Based Staking, P2P Lending and Borrowing, and DeFi Assets Protocols Management in a seamless, transparent, secure, inclusive, and interoperable approach.\r\n\r\nFeatures of SparkDeFi that are already available include:\r\n\r\n- Liquidity Staking\r\n- Pool-Based Staking\r\n- SparkBridge for bridging ERC-20 SRK (Ethereum) to Binance Smart Chain as BEP-20 SRKb token\r\n- SparkSwap AMM Exchange.

A series of token burns have reduced the total supply down to 14,368,540,937 SRK tokens. Quarterly token burns are scheduled in the future to reduce the total supply to its final fixed maximum value of 10 billion SRK tokens. There are currently 6,486,932,911 SRK tokens in circulation.\r\n\r\nOf the initial total supply, 20% of the tokens were distributed to private sale participants. A minimal amount was allocated for sale to avoid any sudden fall in the price of SRK in the market. 7% of the tokens were allocated for marketing and airdrops, and 10% for community development programs. Majority of the tokens were allocated for SparkPoint Ecosystem Development at 38%. Most of the tokens that were burned were also part of this allocation. As for the rest of the tokens, 10% were allocated for the Founders, 5% for the current team, another 5% for future team members, and the remaining 5% for advisors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of SparkPoint?\r\n\r\nSparkPoint is the brainchild of Andrino Agnas, a CPA and cryptocurrency investor based in the Philippines. Andy currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of SparkPoint. Rico Zu\u00f1iga, a serial tech entrepreneur and early advisor of SparkPoint, currently serves as its Chief Technology Officer. Rico has been in the tech industry for more than 16 years and is one of the pioneers in the Philippine tech startup industry.\r\n\r\nSparkPoint started with a staff of 2 in 2018 and was able to grow to 17 full-time and 5 part-time employees in Q1 2021. The company continues to rapidly expand and grow to ensure the delivery of its roadmap.\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Buy SparkPoint (SRK)?\r\n\r\nSRK is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges, with cryptocurrency and stablecoin pairs currently available.\r\n\r\nBitMart currently offers the best liquidity for SRK with support for both SRK/BTC and SRK/ETH pairs. Uniswap offers a decentralized option for trading SRK with Ethereum (ETH) and other ERC-20 tokens. P2PB2B offers a Tether (USDT) option."}, "stader": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20658/large/sd.png?1642927667", "rank": 1292, "colors": ["#333333", "#919191"], "link": "https://staderlabs.com/"}, "eco-value-coin": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7868/large/temp_1524073947125.-325764774.png?1561602099", "rank": 1294, "colors": ["#377946", "#378242"], "link": "https://www.ecovaluecoin.com/", "description": "Eco Value Coin is a Blockchain based Carbon Credit token.

This platform aggregates the liquidity from many DEXs and compares swap data across Uniswap, 0xProject, and 1inch. This allows users to get better trades than they would get on a single DEX by optimizing token pricing, swap fees, and slippage.\r\n\r\nKROM tokens have more utilities planned including an option for gasless swaps, staking, and many more.

Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. The introduction of payment channels, specifically the type first described by the Lightning Whitepaper (which introduced the Lightning Network), seeks to fix the scalability and congestion issues that currently plague blockchain technology. While the Lightning Network operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, Raiden introduces a comparable solution for the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nThere are several key features of the Raiden Network Token. Expedited transfer confirmations (<1 second ). Current transfers on the Ethereum blockchain can take a few seconds to minutes. Private transfers that are not viewable on the global ledger. Solve scalability issues so that Ethereum can create mass adoption, allowing Ethereum to become the peer-to-peer, global payments infrastructure with electronic cash that it was initially designed for. Low fee transactions. Micropayment capability that works in union with any ERC-20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Raiden Network project is being developed by Germany\u2019s Brainbot Technologies AG, a software company devoted to blockchain protocol development. Founded in the year 2000 by Heiko Hees, it currently has between 11 to 50 employees in offices among Berlin, Mainz, and Copenhagen.

Being a core developer for Ethereum, it is evident on how the founder sees the flaws in the current its present protocol with ways to improve it. Interestingly enough, the website does not include RDN as one of their main blockchain developments, which could be attributed to the difficulty of highlighting a wide variety of projects they are currently undertaking on one page. However, there are no updates on the status of the Raiden Network Project on either Twitter nor Medium since December 1st, 2017.\r\n\r\nRaiden can be used for a wide variety of applications and purposes such as Micropayments For Content Distribution, Decentralized M2M Markets, API Access and Fast Decentralized Exchanges.\""}, "clearpool": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19252/large/short_dark.png?1634800836", "rank": 1342, "colors": ["#1A191E", "#396D8F"], "link": "https://clearpool.finance/", "description": "Clearpool is a decentralized capital markets ecosystem, where institutional borrowers can access unsecured loans directly from the DeFi ecosystem.

As of 16 November 2020, over 3,000,000 WABI have been locked out of circulation with growth of the WABI ecosystem. You can track the daily stats at www.wabi.io\r\n\r\nWabi was founded in 2013 by Alex Busarov and Yaz Belinskiy. The two founders first met in high school and after studying at the London School of Economics pursued careers in consulting at McKinsey and Bain respectively. Having worked on several important cases in the Consumer Goods industry, the two became convinced that there should be a more effective way to do marketing and that the inefficiencies in the FMCG industry that often resulted in public health risk were completely solvable with technology and determination.\r\n\r\n"}, "lambda": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4703/large/Lambda-Logo.png?1547219112", "rank": 1395, "colors": ["#13A9C6", "#7FCEDC"], "link": "https://www.lambdastorage.com/en", "description": "Lambda is a fast, safe, and scalable blockchain infrastructure project, which provides decentralized applications (DAPPs) data storage capabilities with unlimited scalability and fulfills services such as multi-chain data co-storage, cross-chain data management, data privacy protection, PDP, and distributed intelligent computing through logic decoupling and independent implementation of Lambda Chain and Lambda DB.\r\n\r\nThrough the logical decoupling and separate implementation of Lambda Chain and Lambda DB, we provide infinitely scalable data storage capabilities to decentralized applications and achieve Multi-chain data cooperative storage, cross-chain data management, data privacy protection, data ownership proof, distributed intelligent computing and other services.

Anything, from artwork and jewelry to rare wines and spirits, luxury watches and collectible vehicles, can be staked and converted into STIMA tokens. More specifically STIMA is a utility token, that through a cryptographic system correlates its native crypto currency to the value of physical assets. Ultimately this token allows for an economic exchange that goes beyond conventional rules surrounding transactional elements related to a given asset. In particular, a person holding an asset with a proven intrinsic value determined by objective valuation metrics can unburden the asset sale process by receiving STIMA. In turn, STIMA as an ecosystem will allow its wider investor base to tap into a pool of historically appreciating assets, with fractional ownership guaranteeing diversification to all token holders. These assets have all been minted by owners prior to the listing date on crypto exchanges, optimizing their asset\u2019s value and allowing them, should they choose to, unlock their tokens by handing staked property into a STIMA accredited vault. They will then be free to exchange the tokens into fiat or other crypto currencies, sell privately or finally convert STIMA into any other real world asset on our platform."}, "morpheus-labs": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3164/large/mitx.png?1604888269", "rank": 1397, "colors": ["#6252D9", "#6252D9"], "link": "https://morpheuslabs.io/", "description": "Morpheus Lab Platform Gives your the flexibility to experiment, using the broad range of functionalities on our platform, to build and develop blockchain applications that suit the needs of your business.

Suterusu project CTO Dr. Huang Lin partners with cryptographers from Centre national de la recherche scientifique and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology co-authored a paper on a new efficient range proof scheme with transparent setup (accepted by a top Cryptography conference Eurocrypt 2021), which serves as the foundation of Suterusu protocol. Suterusu protocol can provide privacy protection for the users\u2019 transaction data without comprising efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo date, Suterusu network has 47 node operators and over 158k mining participates, collectively over 80% staking rate. With 3,000 Suter token reward per 60s, the network generated over 2bn suter token rewards since launch which bring the total circulating supply to 3.7bn suter token. Private round investor\u2019s token have been fully unlocked since Jan 2021, and the foundation\u2019s token will be unlocked by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nWhat is Suter Shield?\r\nSuter Shield is a decentralized, layer-2 solution for transaction and data-protection built on Ethereum, while also can be integrated with other layer-1 projects supporting smart contracts such as Binance Smart Chain, Heco etc.\r\n\r\nIt applies public key homomorphic encryption to protect the transactional amount and conceals the identities of the sender and receiver of a transaction among other system users through invoking zero-knowledge proof. In other words, Suterusu protocol not only provides anonymity for the involved parties and but also transactional confidentiality.\r\n\r\nSuter Shield allows the sender of a transaction to arbitrarily select the target receiver of a confidential transaction without the need of sharing any secret with the receiver beforehand. Therefore, it is not only much more user-friendly, but it also provides a foundation to adapt to more sophisticated privacy-preserving DeFi functionalities such as DEX, insurance, loan, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, compared with other similar solution, Suter Shield not only facilitates the anonymous and confidential transactions of ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but it is also a much more modularized and universal privacy-protection solution for any smart-contract platforms, which is why we can easily transform our solutions to other platforms such as BSC or HECO. Furthermore, the Suter VM not only provides anonymous payment functionality for smart contract platforms but also anonymous BTC cross-chain functionality that will bring more liquidity to the Suter ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSuterusu\u2019s vision to provide privacy-protection for the users of all digital assets, therefore, Suterusu takes regulation compliance to its heart at the beginning of the system design. We apply blacklist and recursive blacklisting to ensure our system is regulation compliant. Any Suter transfer operation is required to compare the sender accounts of a transaction to the blacklist accounts. A transaction that involves any blacklist account will be rejected. This will guarantee the Suterusu ecosystem will effectively eradicate any misbehavior that is against the financial regulation, such as money launder.\r\n\r\nSuter token is native governance and utility token. It\u2019s a fixed-supply ERC-20 token that is used for the purpose of community growth and rewards for the users participating in the Suter DAO voting.\r\n"}, "rio-defi": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12623/large/RFUEL_SQR.png?1602481093", "rank": 1556, "colors": ["#4D86F7", "#789DE7"], "link": "https://riodefi.com/"}, "arc-governance": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15652/large/coingecko-arcx-400x400.png?1634285525", "rank": 1557, "colors": ["#231740", "#2A1E3D"], "link": "https://arcx.money/"}, "naos-finance": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15144/large/bafybeibkztkshitabrf7yqqkqtbjqestjknpgv7lsjfzdsa3ufspagqs2e.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io.png?1622176770", "rank": 1558, "colors": ["#3F2EC5", "#513FE2"], "link": "https://naos.finance/", "description": "NAOS Finance facilitates DeFi lenders and SME borrowers to allow both parties to interact in a permission-less manner on the blockchain.

The TenX blockchain supports the PAY token, which is the fuel that runs the network and is the cryptocurrency using which transactions on the network are made. \r\n\r\nTenX came into existence in 2011 and was created by Toby Hoenisch. While at the university, he took a keen interest in cryptography though he believed that there was no success for cryptocurrencies.In 2012, Toby started trading Bitcoin when he got to know a member of bitcoin-community who was not able to open an account in bank and used TenX crypto currency instead. Toby Hoenisch and Michael Sperk started a one-bit start up in 2015 and introduced us to a debit card, through which payments with bitcoin could be done. \r\n\r\nCryptocurrency adoption is a longstanding problem - with most cryptocurrencies remaining relegated to the realms of hype and not seeing real-world usage, not as much as the enthusiasts would like, at least. This is an important problem being solved by the TenX coin, which seeks to make it easy for the end user to use cryptocurrencies by removing the hurdles associated with keeping different wallets and using them separately.

At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting one's self (also known as hedging) against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes.\r\n\r\nCore Protocol Mechanics\r\nSIREN uses a fully-collateralized approach to writing options that doesn\u2019t require any oracles to function. A single MarketsRegistry contract creates and coordinates individual markets. Once a Market contract is created anyone can interact with it in a permissionless manner. The solvency of a position is ensured at all times by the collateral locked in the smart contract.\r\n\r\nWith SIREN, both the long and short side of the contract are tokenized. The buyer\u2019s side (bToken) gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike priceThe seller\u2019s/writer\u2019s side (wToken) allows the holder to withdraw the collateral (if the option was not exercised) or withdraw the exercise payment (if the option was exercised) from the contract after expiration.\r\n\r\nWhen a trader buys a put the on-chain token amount is multiplied by the strike. For example, a 1 WBTC $20K PUT will result in 20,000 bTokens. For the same reason, a put is just a reversed-assets call (e.g. a WBTC/USDC put is actually a USDC/WBTC call).\u200b\r\n\r\nTokenizing both sides of the contract allows SIREN to create secondary markets for both the long and short exposure. Under such a design in order to become a writer one purchases a wToken from the SirenSwap AMM (see below). A writer can also unwind their short exposure by selling the wToken back to the AMM. This streamlines the write-side mechanics by reducing it to essentially purchasing the underlying collateral at discount\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to a typical design where the writer mints long tokens and has to then sell them in order to realize the premium.\r\n\r\nSirenSwap AMM\r\nBootstrapping liquidity is core to creating a thriving market. Options are notoriously difficult when it comes to that. Not only does liquidity get fractured by combination of strike prices and expirations, it also requires sophistication on the part of liquidity providers in order to ensure fair and sustainable pricing.\r\n\r\nTo ensure liquidity on day 1 the SIREN protocol utilizes a custom SirenSwap AMM that uses a novel combination of a constant-product bonding curve and options minting to trade both bTokens and wTokens. Notably, the AMM doesn\u2019t require any asset in the pool other than bTokens/wTokens in order to trade them against the collateral asset (e.g. WBTC). This increases LP capital efficiency and provides other benefits that we\u2019ll expand on in further posts.\r\n\r\nThe SIREN core team believes that in these early days of Ethereum and DeFi less is more, so they designed SirenSwap to be a model-less market maker. This means there is no complex on-chain pricing formula nor oracle feed required in order for it to function. This makes it easy for anyone to become an LP to potentially earn trading fees."}, "bnktothefuture": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3468/large/bnktothefuture.png?1547351865", "rank": 1650, "colors": ["#541F73", "#6B2D81"], "link": "https://bf-token.bnktothefuture.com/#!/", "description": "At Bnk To The Future, we started our mission in 2010 to build the largest and most reputable Online Investment Platform in order to co-invest with other professional investors in the future of finance and technology.

Liquidity providers can compound their earnings by leveraging their LP tokens to mint UND (decentralized, cross-chain, stablecoin soft pegged to the US dollar) and uETH. The protocol is characterized by several unique features, some of which include:\r\n\r\nGet Liquidity Without Removing Assets From Liquidity Pool\r\nUsers can keep their liquidity on a DEX in a liquidity pool and still have additional stablecoins to trade on different AMMs. For example, if a user has $10,000 locked in the $USDT-$USDC pool on Uniswap, that user can lock up their LPTs on Unbound and mint stable coins ($UND) worth $8,000 on BSC to trade on PancakeSwap while the users liquidity is still on Uniswap thereby enjoying the benefits of fee on Uniswap and having enough liquidity to trade on PancakeSwap. This way Unbound will be able to move liquidity from AMMs across different chains to PancakeSwap and vice versa without physically removing liquidity.\r\n\r\nDebt-Free Borrowing\r\nThe protocol charges no interest on loans taken out by the liquidity providers. To redeem their loan, they simply repay the amount of UND or uETH they borrowed to retrieve their collateral (i.e. their LP tokens). \r\n\r\nLiquidation-free Collateralization\r\nUnbound completely nixes the liquidation engine seen with more collateralized lending platforms. As a result, users do not need to concern themselves with the potential liquidation of their collateral. Instead, Unbound uses SAFU, an emergency insurance fund, to secure the collateralized assets of borrowers during so-called \u2018black swan\u2019 events. \r\n \r\nPerpetual Borrowing \r\nAt Unbound, loans have no fixed repayment deadline. Users can unlock their collateralized assets any time by paying back the outstanding debt \u2014 without any restrictions.\r\n\r\n The UND Stablecoin \r\nUnbound Finance\u2019s first product is the cross-chain, decentralized stablecoin known as UND. It is an ERC-20 token soft-pegged to the US dollar and backed by user deposits.\r\n \r\nSecured Price Oracles\r\nThe platform uses a geometric mean of highly secured price oracles including Uniswap\u2019s TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and Chainlink to obtain accurate asset price information. It also makes use of the \u201cblock limit lock mechanism\u201d as a security measure against flash loan attacks and other related cyber-attacks. This is a protection mechanism that forces users to wait for at least three to five blocks of confirmation to again interact with the smart contracts. Besides this, the protocol has been subjected to a series of audits to further enhance the security of the platform.\r\n \r\nCross-Chain Bridges\r\nUnbound is working to establish strategic partnerships with projects building across multiple blockchains. In line with this, it is also constructing cross-chain bridges to enable UND and other synthetic assets to be transferred across multiple blockchains.

AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar \u00d3\u00f0insson. It was originally based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\">DigiByte</a>.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network\u2019s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Gr\u00f8stl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase.

The Sync Network can help build a needed, stable foundation for the DeFi space and a fully functioning, more robust trustless economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe SYNC Network is composed of two main contracts: the SYNC ERC-20 contract and the Crypto Bond ERC-721 contract. SYNC tokens have an undefined total supply with inflationary and deflationary attributes through the interactions with Crypto Bond investors.\r\n\r\nDespite being a long-term investment, Crypto Bonds do not share anything in common with traditional finance bonds. The name comes from the bonding of liquidity pairs and our own token. Crypto Bonds introduce proof of long-term position in DeFi liquidity pools, and will naturally strengthen the core of DeFi finance as a whole. They are a tradeable, long-term (90 days - 3 years) stake - bonding Uniswap liquidity-pair tokens together with SYNC.\r\n\r\nDeflation of the currency happens when Crypto Bonds are created, burning SYNC from the total supply. Using a Crypto Bond, an investor is able to lock liquidity-pair tokens with the corresponding dollar-to-dollar value in SYNC at some guaranteed interest rate of SYNC upon maturation. Dividend paying versions are also available. Therefore, this occurs in inflation, minting the principle plus interest.\r\n\r\nCrypto Bond Interest Rates\r\nSYNC balances itself through daily, self-correcting interest rates.\r\nInterest rates of bonds depends on three factors.\r\n1.

Our system delegates the tasks of credit checks, risk assessment and other due diligence requirements to pool operators, and creates a set of incentive structures that reward and punish these operators based on performance. \r\n\r\nBanking Nodes manage pools of liquidity, and have the autonomy to delegate these funds to potential borrowers in the parameters they see fit, while lenders can choose an operator that suits their risk-reward preferences to conduct interest bearing activities based on fully transparent data.

With this, node operators lie at the heart of our protocol, and connect lenders with borrowers. \r\n\r\nThe BNPL token is the governance token within the BNPL Pay protocol and has multiple utility functions including bonding a banking node and staking banking nodes as a form of insurance in the event of a default."}, "life-crypto": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18245/large/Logo.10eb9d1a.png?1631081085", "rank": 1848, "colors": ["#00EBB4", "#6A8EE4"], "link": "https://www.lifecrypto.life/", "description": "LifeCrypto is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money."}, "luna-inu": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/25623/large/output-onlinepngtools.png?1653983337", "rank": 1852, "colors": ["#72603B", "#E8AB4D"], "link": "https://luna-inu.com/", "description": "Linu aka Luna Inu is 100% community owned and decentralized.

Launched on June 29, 2021, the wLITI token is suitable for trading on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, whereas the LITI token is only available through liticapital.com and requires KYC. Liti Capital uses the blockchain to manage its share registry and developing its own case management tools on the blockchain is on its roadmap.\r\n\r\nSwiss based Liti Capital creates the wLITI at a LITI token buyers request through its app on its website, which converts the LITI to a wLITI. The buyer is then able to trade the wLITI freely. Liti Capital does not directly sell the wLITI. The wLITI is wrapped at a 5000:1 ratio, and the two tokens will always maintain this ratio. The LITI is a true digital share of Liti Capital that has voting rights, pays dividends and is protected under Swiss law. The LITI is purposely not designed to be on exchanges at this time.\r\n\r\nBoth tokens represent Liti Capital, whose mantra is \u201cprivate equity for all.\u201d Liti Capital works exclusively in a single form of private equity \u2013 Litigation Finance, also called third party funding. This asset class has remained almost entirely exclusive to hedge funds and venture capitalists since its inception several decades ago. Litigation Finance is the practice of financing all or part of a legal case on behalf of a plaintiff for an agreed upon percentage of the court award. Once Liti Capital purchases a portion of ownership of a case, it provides capital that can be used in many ways: legal fees, case management and strategy, expert witnesses, intelligence work, and whatever is needed to give the plaintiff the best chance of winning the case and collecting the award. The portion owned by Liti Capital becomes a \u201clitigation asset\u201d that backs the LITI token.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Liti Capital\u2019s wLITI Unique?\r\nBy wrapping its LITI Token, Liti Capital has given DEX retail traders a utility token that is a wrapped version of an asset backed equity token. At any time, a wLITI token holder can unwrap 5000 wLITI and exchange for 1 LITI token with KYC in place. wLITI token holders can participate in bounties and be part of class action suits against crypto cons, scams and rug pulls as spelled out in the Liti Capital Tokenomics.\r\n\r\nLiti Capital is offering a new way to get retail traders involved in this asset class, by tokenizing its equity, Liti Capital is lowering the barrier of entry for a much wider pool of potential investors. According the Laws and Business of Litigation Finance, Litigation finance funds post returns between 50-100% on average at the portfolio level. It\u2019s also a strong counter weight to the litigation spending power of wealthy defendants, it\u2019s helps ensure ethical justice.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Liti Capital?\r\n\r\nThe original idea for Liti Capital was born from its three Co-Founders, Jonas Rey, Andy Christen and Jaime Delgado. Jonas owns Athena Intelligence, a renowned Swiss Intelligence agency with a global reach in identifying assets needed for successful litigation award recovery. Andy is a data scientist and innovation entrepreneur who co-founded several startups running on the blockchain. Jaime is a well-known blockchain expert and ETH developer as well as the CTO of other startup companies. The Founders brought David Kay as Chief Investment Officer. David previously built a billion-dollar fund exclusively for litigation finance and has won the largest litigation award at that time of over one billion dollars."}, "unicly-mystic-axies-collection": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14921/large/uaxie-mystic.png?1619055573", "rank": 1919, "colors": ["#24283C", "#9E7D39"], "link": "https://www.app.unic.ly/#/utoken-contract/0x68b1cadb8d5ab0c97fe9d9fbe0eb60acb329fe3f", "description": "Collection of 24 mystic Axies \u2014 18 single mystics (6 plants, 6 aquas and 6 beasts), 2 single mystic rare classes (bug and reptile) and 4 double mystics"}, "uniqly": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14808/large/Hnet-com-image.png?1618538742", "rank": 1923, "colors": ["#9D4DB5", "#D94A8E"], "link": "https://www.uniqly.io/", "description": "Uniqly.io - the first marketplace and escrow that allows you to create and trade NFT tokens with the possibility of materializing them in the real world."}, "nftlaunch": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18140/large/nftl.PNG?1630652662", "rank": 1925, "colors": ["#0F4479", "#1A95C7"], "link": "https://www.nftlaunch.network/", "description": "The FIRST deflationary NFT Launchpad that offers no gas wars, fair distribution and FREE NFT airdrops of new and upcoming NFT projects."}, "thx-network": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/21323/large/logo-thx-resized-200-200.png?1638945575", "rank": 1926, "colors": ["#786E0E", "#F9E414"], "link": "https://thx.network", "description": "THX Network allows you to create and embed your own ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens in any app or website, boosting engagement and increasing revenue. \r\nUse cases include loyalty programs, the offering of collectibles by creators, cashbacks, and engagement incentives.\r\n\r\nThe $THX governance token lives both on Ethereum and Polygon (formerly Matic).\r\n\r\nThis project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under agreement No 82888 (Blockpool) and No 824509 (Block.IS)."}, "qiibee": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2365/large/qbx-icon-dark.png?1554082393", "rank": 1930, "colors": ["#258FD7", "#9054AD"], "link": "https://qiibeefoundation.org/", "description": "Through qiibee\u2019s plug & play solutions, businesses worldwide are running and operating loyalty programs on the blockchain in a few hours, while reducing costs and maximizing customer lifetime value."}, "the-crypto-prophecies": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15054/large/tcp.PNG?1619579195", "rank": 1932, "colors": ["#69358A", "#9D4AAD"], "link": "https://www.thecryptoprophecies.com/", "description": "The Crypto Prophecies is the world\u2019s cutest price-prediction game that is partially owned and operated by its players\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the project, take a look at our website (https://www.thecryptoprophecies.com/)\r\n\r\nInspired by Pokemon, trading games, price prediction games, and a passion for Technical Analysis and trading currency markets.\r\n\r\nEnter the Crypto World and put your proclaimed crypto prophecy to the test.

These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn\u2019t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\r\n\r\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst.

The primary purpose of AME is to facilitate and monetize the working of AME Chain to enable developers to build and run distributed applications (called Dapps).\r\n\r\nAME Chain is a Turing complete blockchain framework, as it gives a foundation to programming languages using which you can write contracts that can solve any reasonable computational problem. AME Chain is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a consensus-based virtual machine that decodes the compiled contracts in bytecodes and executes them on the Ethereum network nodes. It also uses algorithms to prevent denial-of-service attacks that are widely observed in cryptocurrency markets.\r\n\r\nAME Chain network is a group of nodes, connected to every other node in a peer-to-peer mechanism. Each node consists of a copy of the entire blockchain data store and competes with other nodes to mine the next block by validating transactions. If a new block is added, the blockchain gets updated and is propagated to the entire network so that every node is in sync.\r\n\r\nAME Chain uses Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) as the consensus method that gives a small and designated number of blockchain actors the power to validate transactions or interactions with the network and to update its more or less distributed registry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of AME Chain?\r\n\r\nKamalakannan Venkatraman, Co-Founder and the important person behind AME Chain. His professional career started at American Express, where he shaped the career towards the Fintech Industry. Later on, he founded MoneyQ, a global financial consulting firm where he helped improve business strategies and increase revenue of over a 20 fintech firms. \r\n\r\nJaved Mohamed, Co-Founder of AME Chain and the Founder of AMEPOS, a successful tech software with over 2000 clients spread across India, Malaysia, Singapore, UAE and USA. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes AME Chain Unique?\r\n\r\nAME Chain is the world\u2019s first Quantum blockchain that uses quantum security to secure its cryptography - encryption, hashing and digital signatures. Whereas other blockchains use Pseudo random numbers (PRN) for these operations, AME Chain uses Quantum random numbers (QRN) generated from a laser based quantum source.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many AME Chain (AME) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe AME Chain has announced that a total of 1.5 Billion AME will be released in circulation. At the moment, about 500 Million AME have already entered the market.\r\n\r\n1 Billion AME will be put into circulation after August 2023 and a massive AME burn event is planned on this supply.\r\n\r\nThe AME distribution is as follows: 4.8% will be towards Staking rewards, 6.4% of AME coins will be distributed among team members, 4% of AME will be distributed towards Development, 16% of AME is allotted for Community grants, 40% of AME is taken aside for Burn event and 28.8% is for the Company Reserves & Partnerships.\r\n\r\nAME price during the initial seed sale, held on September 2020, was $0.0075. Given the recent ATH, that represents an impressive 20X return on investment (ROI) \r\n\r\n\r\nHow Is the AME Chain Network Secured?\r\n\r\nAME Chain network is secured by multiple layers.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tQuantum security - Quantum Random Numbers are used in cryptographic operations\r\n\u2022\tCryptographic hashes to generate and validate blocks\r\n\u2022\tProof-of-Authority to form consensus between trusted nodes\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Buy AME Chain (AME)?\r\n\r\nAME coin can be purchased on few exchanges. One choice to trade AME is MEXC as it has the highest AME/USDT trading volume, $137,322,203 as of March 2022.\r\n\r\nNext is Gate.io, with a trading volume of $90,112,897. Other options to trade AME include Bit global, Bkex and XT.com. Of course, it is important to note that investing in cryptocurrency comes with a risk, just like any other investment opportunity.\r\n\r\nTo check AME price live in the fiat currency of your choice, you can use CoinMarketCap\u2019s converter feature directly on the https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/amepay/ .Popular AME price pairs include: AME/USDT, AME/ETH"}, "catapult": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14509/large/8926.png?1645686353", "rank": 1955, "colors": ["#322932", "#601E54"], "link": "https://catapult.ac/", "description": "A2DAO - Project accelerator & Investment platform for people.\r\n\r\nA2DAO aims to connect startups with smart capital while simultaneously helping to cultivate a passionate community for each individual project.\r\n\r\nOur team of experts will assist projects in marketing, development, tokenomics, and other critical areas of growth. We have reshaped the old fundraising model by distributing allocation to our community members rather than to close-knit VCs and institutions.\r\n\r\nThe A2DAO (ATD) connects promising crypto projects and retail investors. Holding the ATD allows to get the opportunity to invest in crypto startups, both at an early and public stage.

Accelerator program is an excellent opportunity for early-stage ventures but it also gives ATD holders lucrative investment opportunities.\r\n\r\nEach project that applies to enter the accelerator program will be required to purchase a certain number of tokens in order to pass further audit by our team. When projects receive the status of \u201caccelerator project\u201d they will receive the status of \u201cpartner\u201d and have access to all of our marketing tools.\r\n\r\nChosen projects will receive expertise as part of the A2Jump accelerator program. We believe that the blockchain movement is a fully democratic one and projects that reflect this value deserve to receive the best global expertise and adequate funding.\r\n\r\nThe success of blockchain models applied to solve real-world problems has popularized the technology. In addition, the massive potential of digital assets has caused traditional financial institutions to take notice and the current market rally is largely attributed to an inflow of institutional capital. This has also attracted millions of retail investors and crypto enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nHowever many of these new investors are setting foot into the world of crypto for the first time. They lack the expertise, financial knowledge, and technical capabilities to approach the market with confidence and truly succeed. A2DAO will provide its community investment opportunities with a clear and thorough understanding of each respective project\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nProjects will be rated through the A2DAO voting system and internal audit by founders, team members, and our community.

There\u2019s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\">(Siacoin)</a> to identity verification <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic\">(Civic)</a>. But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin\u2019s</a> original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we\u2019ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions."}, "exrnchain": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1049/large/exrn.png?1616039914", "rank": 2083, "colors": ["#79A9F6", "#C1D7FA"], "link": "https://exrn.org/", "description": "EXRNchain is an innovative crosschain technology"}, "terablock": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15622/large/tbc.png?1621345335", "rank": 2084, "colors": ["#2D0A58", "#E50C83"], "link": "https://terablock.ai/", "description": "The prospect of investing in DeFi can be daunting for many, and rightly so.

Built on the Ethereum blockchain the Envision Stock platform will act as a tailored NFT marketplace with the UI/UX specifically for the purchase and sale of stock media. \r\n\r\nThe Envision Stock platform is completely fee free which means 100% of the content revenue goes direct to the creator. This allows creators to reduce their pricing, leading to a net benefit to both sides of the exchange and creates a more open transparent market than current solutions. Content will be accompanied by a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) which corresponds to that specific piece of content. The NFT will provide proof of ownership which is validated by participants on the network so there can be no dispute over who owns the rights to said content. The functionality of NFT\u2019s gives the content creator the control to either sell complete ownership rights, rights to one in a limited collection or single rights to one of many.\r\n\r\nThe Envision platform will be powered by VIS which is Envisions fungible ERC20 utility token.

Currently, the solution is implemented on the following blockchains: Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum.\r\n\r\nThe platform architecture, as part of the implementation on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain and Ethereum, supports the following functionality: \r\n\u25cf Unlimited expirations \r\n\u25cf Pairing of any coins for the corresponding blockchain \r\n\u25cf American-style options (execute at any time prior to expiration date) \r\n\u25cf Limit and market orders. Limit order - user chooses the parameters (price, term). Market order - the user buys/sells what is available in the trading terminal. \r\n\u25cf 2-level system of commissions. Maker fee - if the user adds liquidity to the order book (puts an order not at the current market), a reduced commission is applied to it. Taker fee - if the user removes liquidity from the order book (takes out the current orders), the standard commission is applied to him. \r\n\u25cf Sellers of options pledge 100% of the collateral, thus the failure of the contract is not possible. \u25cf Option sellers can participate in the Liquidity Incentivize Program. Their placed orders can be forwarded to protocols like Venus/Compound, where option sellers can earn extra money.\r\n\r\ndelta.theta\u00a0is a simple, clear and functional product for \"farmers\". By using delta.theta LITE, in 3 clicks any farmer can qualitatively increase his APY by choosing a simple ready-made risk management scheme. Our product solves two major pains of \"farmers\":\u00a0\r\n\r\n1. First, through delta.theta, farmers buy protection during the farming period. The farmer invests in stablecoins and \"strong\" coins (ETH, e.t.c.), and the output is a coin that is subject to a significant drop. Thus, the farmer needs to get protection from the dump of the token that is being farmed. \r\n2. Efficient capital management. Today's farmers in search of APY growth use quite a wide range of products, from simple farming to flashloans solutions. Options allow them to participate with less capital leverage. We started out with a simple one - by allowing farmers to sell options. You sell an option - and you make money. \r\n\r\nThe farmer has an opportunity to make money on his desire to use his own capital more efficiently. Example: A farmer wants to sell a coin at a higher price and comes to delta.theta, he uses the Sell High option and places a limit order through the delta.theta LITE app and the magic begins: a. first, his order can go into LIP (disabling feature) - this means that his order is deposited on the Venus protocol and the farmer is paid the appropriate APY b. Secondly, if the buyer bought the farmer's option, he paid him a premium. But the option may not be executed. So, the farmer has already earned in 2 places just on his desire to be efficient."}, "spaceswap-milk2": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12771/large/milk.png?1633423719", "rank": 2364, "colors": ["#04118A", "#4D49A3"], "link": "https://spaceswap.app/"}, "primas": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/917/large/primas.png?1548331951", "rank": 2365, "colors": ["#EF5F14", "#F16B0F"], "link": "https://primas.io/", "description": "Primas is a platform for high-quality content centred in Distributed Trusted Content Protocol or DTCP.

Coin creates an open financial system made up of decentralized solutions that empower consumers to execute financial transactions with freedom and ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Up the Coin Ecosystem?\r\n\r\nToken\r\n\r\nThe Coin Ecosystem is powered by the $COIN token, a digital asset and network access token that enables holders to execute Coin smart contracts, stake interest, and execute governance rights. $COIN also represents a stake in the Coin protocol and is the voting currency for all proposed protocol and platform changes by the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallet\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet is an all-in-one decentralized cryptocurrency wallet, exchange, and AI assistant. Coin Wallet includes a native cryptocurrency wallet and exchange for users to store and swap popular digital assets directly with each other. Unlike many other decentralized exchanges, swaps can occur cross-chain across different blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, and more. \r\n\r\nCoin Wallet is non-custodial, lives in a browser extension, and is non-susceptible to hacks as users are the only people that have and can access their funds. For exchanging assets, Coin Wallet uses atomic swap technology to handle direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions across different blockchains.\r\n\r\nCoin's integrated artificial intelligence (AI) assistant transforms the traditional financial experience by highlighting and providing insights for blockchain-specific keywords on any web page. Additionally, the Coin AI enables users to execute transactions by simply typing a command in any input field.\r\n\r\nThe combination of decentralized P2P technology, cross-chain interoperability, and AI integration, creates a secure and unparalleled experience to help consumers easily manage their digital assets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwap\r\n\r\nCoin Swap is a P2P cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) that is compatible with any Internet web browser. It utilizes the same atomic swap technology in the Coin Wallet excluding a native wallet and the Coin AI assistant \u2014 this enables users to connect their favorite Web3 cryptocurrency wallet (including Coin Wallet) without the need to install a browser extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders and Advisors of Coin?\r\n\r\nCoin is assembled from a diverse and experienced team of technology veterans spanning the information technology, financial, and blockchain industries.\r\n\r\nFounder and CEO Damon Nam is formerly an accomplished 17-year IT services professional at Microsoft. He held multiple management roles for the largest software company in the world and in his last role, was responsible for a $90M book of business as a Partner Program Director for Microsoft North America.\r\n\r\nCTO Byron Levels is an experienced 20-plus-year technologist who has worked for many Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Pepsi, and American Airlines to name a few. He has a strong background in developing and deploying enterprise applications.\r\n\r\nCoin is supported by a team of advisors who are the pioneers in AI and blockchain. They include founder and CEO of FetchyFox Christina Apatow, founder and CEO of Celsius Network and investor of VoIP Alex Mashinsky, and co-founder of the Augur prediction market and Ausum Ventures, Jeremy Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Coin Unique?\r\n\r\nNative cross-chain interoperability\r\n\r\nNo more wrapped tokens. No more sending to multiple exchanges to swap tokens.\r\n\r\nUnlike many industry leading decentralized exchanges, one of the unique features of the Coin network is swapping directly between different blockchains. The Coin network leverages atomic swap technology and Hash Time Lock Contracts to handle direct peer-to-peer trustless transactions. This removes the need for custodians, middlemen, and escrow agents. Coin Wallet and Coin Swap supports popular digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC20 supported tokens, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn AI assistant providing insights\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet includes browser extension support for popular web browsers such as Google Chrome.\r\n\r\nWhen installed, the browser extension extends its capability by using AI technology to execute transactions faster and provide insights to help users save time and money. By recognizing finance and blockchain-related keywords from any webpage, the AI assistant can provide education, pricing information, or help consumers execute financial transactions directly from any webpage with an input field.\r\n\r\n\r\nConversational-level experience\r\n\r\nUsability and ease-of-use remain a significant barrier-to-entry and problem for many consumers in the blockchain industry.\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet and Coin Swap uses natural language processing technology to recognize intent while helping users navigate through their financial journey. Coin also leverages this technology for alternate input sources such as text (messaging apps) and voice (digital assistants).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many Coin ($COIN) Tokens are Available and In Circulation?\r\n\r\n$COIN has a maximum supply of 100M tokens. Approximately 49M of the tokens are circulating with the remainder of those tokens distributed in the network\u2019s staking reserve and Uniswap liquidity pool.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Buy Coin ($COIN)?\r\n\r\nAs of December 2020, Coin ($COIN) can be traded at Uniswap.\r\n"}, "evedo": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7721/large/Variations-09.png?1549979992", "rank": 2372, "colors": ["#0D325D", "#0B2F63"], "link": "https://www.evedo.co", "description": "Evedo is a blockchain based platform, consisting of B2B & B2C Marketplaces.

Medicalchain provides solutions to today\u2019s health record problems. The platform is built to securely store and share electronic health records. By digitizing health records and empowering users we can leverage countless industry synergies.\r\n\r\nMedicalchain is building a platform for secure storage and utilization of electronic health records on the blockchain. The company is also building a telemedicine platform to allow users to directly connect with healthcare professionals, share their records and get consultations, second opinions, online through a secure channel.The company was originally founded in February 2016 to provide a software solution inside hospitals. The solution is known as \u2018Discharge Summary\u2019 and it uses a workflow tool to accurately write an assessment of a patient as they are being discharged from surgery or a long hospital visit. The software is currently being used by hospitals in UK and the team decided to extend this project and go further with Medicalchain. \r\n\r\nMedicalchain wants people to have access to their health records everywhere. Today, you can travel far and wide and you will have access to your phone, contacts, photos, files, bank accounts but not your health records - probably the most important and life saving information you need. In most developed countries around the world you, as a patient, have a legal right to request your records. Medicalchain is providing you with a platform to do that. But more importantly, Medicalchain wants its users to be able to use it immediately by communicating and sharing (on a time limited basis) with other doctors. The bigger vision is to allow pharmaceutical, insurance and other healthcare organisations and stakeholders to be able to interact with health records on patients' terms. Medicalchain believes that health records should be a part of everyone\u2019s life and not just referred to when someone is ill."}, "wiva": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18142/large/n8Vu43vs.png?1630656531", "rank": 2416, "colors": ["#9D1330", "#9D1330"], "link": "https://wiva.xyz", "description": "WIVA is turning fine wine into NFTs that are being traded through our fintech platform.

Decentralised: ESD has an entirely decentralized on-chain governance. Any changes or upgrades to the protocol need to be voted on by the community of token holders.\r\n\u00a0\r\nii. Composable: Its protocol is centred around an ERC-20 token: ESD. This enables it to work across the DeFi ecosystem and act as the governance token for the protocol.\r\n\u00a0\r\niii. Self-Stabilising: Utilization of an on-chain price oracle (Uniswap V2)\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\niv. Opt-in Supply Adjustments: ESD supply expansions and contractions are incentivised and voluntary\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does ESD work?\r\n\r\nESD\u2019s price mechanism uses a seigniorage model. This means, if the market demands more ESD i.e. when ESD goes above $1, more ESD coins will be minted to meet that demand and bring the price back down to $1. That extra minted money supply is then distributed to the coupon holders first before the ESD holders that chose to lock their ESD.\r\n\r\nIf market demand is lagging behind supply, ESD may fall below $1. So a supply contraction is needed to spur price. During this contractionary phase, a coupon redemption system comes into play, where users may purchase these coupons with ESD coins in exchange for a premium (i.e. receive more ESD coins) only when the ESD price goes back to $1. Basically, users agree to burn their ESD in exchange for coupons redeemable later on - reducing ESD\u2019s supply until price goes back up to $1. However, coupons have to be redeemed within 90 epochs (30 days), which carries significant risk if the price of ESD does not go back to $1 as coupons will be rendered obsolete after 90 epochs without redemption.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis protocol relies on a \u2018voluntary system\u2019 that is very much depended on by its incentive mechanism. This poses a risk to the currency in the event that users decide to ignore the coupon incentives and no longer participate in the system, the protocol\u2019s ability to maintain its peg at $1 will be directly hampered.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that the price of ESD as of January 2021 is $0.285, which is more than 70% down from its supposed peg. This may indicate that the coupon and incentive mechanisms ESD is based on may be waning in effect.\u00a0"}, "unique-utility-token": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/23382/large/D31DBA6B-FB7E-4ACB-82B4-98E255C1C483.jpg?1643962784", "rank": 2427, "colors": ["#9D112B", "#7A4B5B"], "link": "https://unique.finance/", "description": "Unique Utility Token (UNQT) is an ERC20 token made to work with borderless exchanges.

Charges boost the presence of posts in user feeds and reward the post creator/commenter with SPN tokens within 24 hours of the Charge being given. This process gives monetary weight to the liking system commonly employed on social platforms and will enable creators to directly connect with and receive compensation from their audiences.\r\n\r\nStaking\r\nSapien operates on a proof-of-value protocol. Users can stake their SPN tokens using the Sapien smart contract, which progressively unlocks the tokens over the course of a calendar year.

Furthermore, such a system should have deep, long-term, and protocol-owned liquidity to reduce friction and maintain tight pegs. It is our belief that creating such a system brings us one step closer to creating a more peaceful and prosperous future for mankind. The first step in building such a system is to re-think 'money' based on the following principles: On-chain and decentralized: Reduce custodial risk. This stands in direct contrast to centralized stable coins that may have significant custodial risk. Value-stable: Frictionless trade requires using money whose value does not significantly fluctuate. Value stable is a relative term. For example, depending on the use case, the best money should be designed to be stable relative to national currencies (Such as USD or Euro), a basket of currencies, an inflation adjusted currency, in-game virtual currencies, reward points (imagine a stable coin that traces a hotel or airline point system on chain) etc. The Spice Trade platform allows building appropriate on-chain decentralized money for all these use cases.\r\nScalable: Money is a tool of trade. The last thing a successful trade network needs is friction in scaling its monetary system. Modular: As we will demonstrate in the rest of this whitepaper, the Spice Trade protocol is fully modular to accommodate both immediately predicted needs as well future unknown use cases. Open-Source: Creating an open-source ecosystem where anyone with a good idea can contribute and build on top of the Spice Trade protocol is one of our core values Capital-Efficient: While over-collateralized on-chain stable coins pioneered the non-custodial money movement, we believe they will play a relatively smaller role in the future of money."}, "play-it-forward-dao": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22904/large/pif.png?1642938913", "rank": 2529, "colors": ["#887839", "#FACA00"], "link": "https://playitfwd.io/", "description": "FIRST GUILD TO MARKET IN 2022, Play It Forward DAO redefines Play-to-Earn by enabling a Plug-and-Play Metaverse\r\n\r\nPoised to be the growth engine of the Metaverse, with a unique dual business model:\r\n- Guild management SaaS platform with 20,000+ users pre-launch (P2E Board)\r\n- 3rd largest guild globally with 3,000+ scholars (PIF Guild)\r\n\r\nP2E Board - one-stop platform to connect guilds with scholars, where guilds can find, track, manage, and pay their scholars across multiple games - in the process making Play-to-Earn more accessible.

The AppCoins project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app. Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over 230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications. \r\n\r\nAppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their games or apps in the app store.The \u201cAppCoin\u201d ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating the return of the investment to the developers.\r\nMost industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.\r\n\r\nOnce the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to good returns for investors.\r\n\r\nAppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident that the returns of the AppCoins\u2019 solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them.

Additionally, the ODEM platform allows qualified and trusted individuals from across the global education scene to create customized curriculum that can help students gain practical knowledge about the market at large and allow them to gain hands-on experience within various industrial sectors.

Issuance\r\n\r\nWe will adopt a mechanism called \u201cTrade Contribution + Simultaneous Release\u201d to issue AT.\r\n\r\n4.1 Trade Contribution\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage our users to trade on ABCC, we have decided to reward our members with 50% of the total supply of AT. \r\n\r\nOf the 50% rewarded to users, 4/5 (i.e. 40% of the total supply) will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the \u201cTrade-to-Mine\u201d (ToM) mechanism. The other 1/5 (i.e. 10% of the total supply) will be granted to users who traded prior to the issuance of AT.\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Trade-to-Mine (ToM)\r\n\r\n40% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the \u201cTrade-to-Mine\u201d (ToM) mechanism.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspirations from the Bitcoin mining model, we have adopted a similar inflation model for AT.  In particular, the ToM mechanism includes two steps, i.e., \u201crelease\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d. \r\n\r\nRelease\r\n\r\nThe release of AT follows a half-life decay pattern. There are 6 half-life periods in total with each period being 120 days (roughly 4 months). We will release half of the total supply of AT in the first 120 days. The number of AT to be released in the following half-life period will be halved, and so on. Please see details of AT release schedule below. \r\n\r\nWithin each half-life period, one \u201cblock\u201d will be generated every 6 hours. The same number of AT will be released for every block inside the same half-life period. For example, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period is calculated as follows.\r\n\r\nThe total number of AT in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000;\r\nThe number of days in the 1st half-life period: 120 days;\r\nOne block will be generated every 6 hours;\r\nThe number of blocks to be generated every day: 24 hours / 6 hours = 4;\r\nTherefore, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000/120 / (24 hours / 6 hours) = 87,500.\r\nDistribution\r\n\r\nWe will distribute AT released in a block to members per the percentage of their trading fees within that block.\r\n\r\nIf it so happens that there are no members eligible for the rewards in a certain block, the released AT assigned to this block will be distributed in the next block.\r\n\r\n4.1.2 Reward for Historical Trades\r\n\r\n10% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward eligible existing users.  We will distribute the rewards to the eligible users based on their cumulative trade volume contribution ending 24:00 June 27th, 2018 (UTC+8). The rewards will be frozen for 180 days after the launch of AT.\r\n\r\n4.2 Simultaneous Release\r\n\r\nAT will be released to the platform, team and investors in proportion to the number of AT released and distributed to members via Trade-to-Mine (ToM).\r\n\r\nThe number of AT released via Simultaneous Release = the number of AT released and distributed via ToM * (50% / 40%)."}, "hyperion": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7171/large/Hyperion.png?1558069078", "rank": 2803, "colors": ["#957551", "#BB9366"], "link": "https://www.hyn.space/", "description": "Hyperion aims to establish a global decentralized map economy for 7B people and 10B devices.

In addition, users are not penalised for inaccurate predictions. The aim is broaden participation with our protocol as incumbent markets are typically complex with high financial risk for accuracy therefore acting as a barrier to entry. This protocol provides high yields for participation by coupling guaranteed staking returns alongside favourable bitcoin (BTC) and native token rewards.\r\n\r\nThere will be a focus on incentivising both early adoption and rewarding long-term engagement with the project. The long-standing Aristotelian ideal of the Wisdom of the Crowd proposes that group predictions have a higher propensity for accuracy. In line with the key values displayed in the crypto sphere, and aforementioned theorem, we want to celebrate and reward collaboration. We don\u2019t penalise for inaccuracy, meaning your stake isn\u2019t at risk when you predict and if the weighted average prediction of a staking pool is on the mark, then everyone wins. Community is at the core of TotemFi; We are run by our members and we value their insights.\r\n\r\nThis protocol will also serve a broader purpose: as a community-created indicator of crypto- market sentiment. A longer-term goal is for both novices and veterans alike to be able to use our product to assess how our community feels about market trends, and use this to their advantage.\r\n\r\nCan the crypto community collaboratively achieve the impossible - to predict the future price of BTC?

Both users deposit tokens into the smart contract as a guarantee for a successful transaction. In the event of a dispute, the user will not release the funds, and can start the process of resolving the dispute.

The founder of the decentralized hedge fund can only swap / trade with user funds, while withdrawals and payouts are automated by smart contracts, therefore eliminating the possibility of scam or pyramid schemes.\r\nThe platform will also enable users to participate in direct p2p lending, where every user sets the loan amount, interest rate, loan duration, and collateral requirement, which can be even under or over 100% allowing for under and over collateralized loans. Every borrower on the platform will have a credit rating, and lenders can set the minimum credit rating required to take the loan, and even set different collateral requirements and interest rates for users with different credit ratings. If someone never got liquidated on their loan aka never defaulted and always paid back the loan amount + interest on time, they will have a very high credit rating, while users who get liquidated / default many times will see their credit rating slip down. Credit rating can be improved or worsened over time. \r\nThe platform will also have a secondary marketplace for synthetic assets where users can buy and sell the loans, therefore allowing lenders to exit their positions and delegate the risk and waiting time to other users. So for example, if a user is lending a loan with a 10% interest rate, but they need money / liquidity urgently or they simply don\u2019t want to wait until the end of the loan duration, they can instead decide to sell their loan, and maybe someone will buy it for 4% instantly, which would mean a 6% profit for them after they receive the original 10% interest at the end of the loan\u2019s duration, which is beneficial for both a buyer and the seller. For the seller (the original lender), they don\u2019t have to wait and they are getting a smaller profit with no risk, and for the buyer of the loan, they are receiving a higher profit for waiting until the end of the loan\u2019s duration.

Users can directly connect to or conclude transactions with any node on the network at a low cost, so that information and value can be effectively spread throughout the blockchain network. Then, publishers will achieve their goals, communicators will get token rewards, benefiting all nodes spread throughout the network. \r\n\r\nIn addition, AiLink capture and process massive users open data on blockchain networks with AI operations, design unique formulas, match users with high affinity, to achieve the desired results, such as in the same crowd of music lovers, the probability of the person matching the music preferences matches is higher depending on the user's preference for the genre of music. The frequency of interaction between users will also be used to calculate friends degree, so as to continuously improve the relationship between friends. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, AiLink will provide more user-friendly applications, AiLink will start with social games, let users get the concept and value of blockchain more simply and directly, then improve the entire social ecosystem gradually.

Furthermore, such a system should have deep, long-term, and protocol-owned liquidity to reduce friction and maintain tight pegs. It is our belief that creating such a system brings us one step closer to creating a more peaceful and prosperous future for mankind. The first step in building such a system is to re-think 'money' based on the following principles: On-chain and decentralized: Reduce custodial risk. This stands in direct contrast to centralized stable coins that may have significant custodial risk. Value-stable: Frictionless trade requires using money whose value does not significantly fluctuate. Value stable is a relative term. For example, depending on the use case, the best money should be designed to be stable relative to national currencies (Such as USD or Euro), a basket of currencies, an inflation adjusted currency, in-game virtual currencies, reward points (imagine a stable coin that traces a hotel or airline point system on chain) etc. The Spice Trade platform allows building appropriate on-chain decentralized money for all these use cases.\r\nScalable: Money is a tool of trade. The last thing a successful trade network needs is friction in scaling its monetary system. Modular: As we will demonstrate in the rest of this whitepaper, the Spice Trade protocol is fully modular to accommodate both immediately predicted needs as well future unknown use cases. Open-Source: Creating an open-source ecosystem where anyone with a good idea can contribute and build on top of the Spice Trade protocol is one of our core values Capital-Efficient: While over-collateralized on-chain stable coins pioneered the non-custodial money movement, we believe they will play a relatively smaller role in the future of money."}, "moar": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15057/large/moar.PNG?1619589388", "rank": 3297, "colors": ["#46464B", "#828285"], "link": "https://moardefi.finance/", "description": "MOAR is a DeFi lending platform built to unlock the power of inter-chain derivatives primitives."}, "micromoney": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1356/large/micromoney.png?1548085045", "rank": 3299, "colors": ["#F7690A", "#EB8034"], "link": "https://www.micromoney.io/", "description": "MicroMoney A.I. platform uses complex algorithms to predict creditworthiness of all customers and in just 15 minutes a borrower can get their very first loan in his/her life just from their smartphone.

Using GasToken can subsidize high gas prices on transactions to do everything from arbitraging decentralized exchanges to buying into ICOs early. GasToken is also the first contract on the Ethereum network that allows users to buy and sell gas directly, enabling long-term \"banking\" of gas that can help shield users from rising gas prices.\r\n\r\nGas is a fundamental resource in the Ethereum network. Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees. Using GasToken on an eligible transaction, you can save money on the Ethereum network today.\r\n\r\nGas prices on Ethereum are hard to predict; they can be as cheap as 1 gwei or less at off-peak hours, while some transactions pay into the hundreds of gwei to buy into that juicy ICO or hit an order on EtherDelta before any other players. Users who need to be mined quickly or first often engage in fierce bidding wars, bidding wars in which using GasToken provides an enormous advantage by letting you perform the same transactions while spending less gas.\r\n\r\nCompounding this effect, Ethereum blocks are starting to fill up, making block space ever more coveted."}, "satopay": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12220/large/stop.png?1598241582", "rank": 3846, "colors": ["#DA6964", "#E9E2CE"], "link": "https://satopay.network", "description": "Cutting edge crypto payment solution for all e-commerce platforms and e-shops with integrated major cryptocurrencies."}, "fastswap": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13567/large/fastswap.jpeg?1622794717", "rank": 3847, "colors": ["#517663", "#A3C0B1"], "link": "https://fastswap.exchange/", "description": "FastSwap A decentralized exchange for erc20 Token and cross-chain swap powered by Polkadot.

Digix has two cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digix-gold\">Digix Gold (DGX)</a> and DigixDAO (DGD), each of which serves a key role in the structure.  The company proudly gets 99.99 percent of its gold from LBMA-approved refiners, with zero percent from fractional reserves, delivering confidence. With Digix, investors can take advantage of the stability and value of gold as well as the ease of cryptocurrency. Digix essentially tokenizes gold within Ethereum. It takes advantage of the Distributed Ledger\u2019s immutability, auditability, and transparency, applying all these benefits to the precious physical asset of gold. Additionally, Digix has developed multiple technologies, such as the DGX tokens and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/digixdao-introduces-gold-tokens-ethereum\">introduced a new Proof of Asset protocol</a> (POA).\r\n\r\nA key feature of Digix is its physical gold bullion. By investing, users buy bullion from the LBMA refineries, including the Assay Certificates from refiners like Nadir Bullion, PAMP Suisse, Valcambi, and others. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. Every quarter, it audits each gold asset within the safehouse vaults. This auditor has been in business since 1828 and is a world leader in certification, inspection, and testing services. With such a long track record, investors should be able to trust Bureau Veritas for their auditing services. Finally, Digix involves recast, which means customers can take their DGX delivery at the partnering custodial vault. \r\n\r\nDigix incorporated in Singapore in December 2014 and the DGD crowdsale took place on March 30th, 2016. It was the first ever crowdsale and major Distributed Autonomous Organization hosted on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The sale intended to run for 30 days but met its 5.5 million dollars hard cap in just 12 hours, selling 1.7 million DGD tokens and reserving 300,000 for the Digix team. Pledges who sent over 15,000 USD worth of Ether received a special badge which will allow them to submit proposals to the DigixDAO. For better or worse, when you see the word DAO, you might think of hacking. In July 2017, over 4000 DGD were indeed stolen due to a vulnerability in the crowdsale smart contract. The bug was eventually fixed and the tokens reimbursed to the 35 affected addresses.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market crashed. DGD was the only coin in the top 100 to rise in value in that time. Perhaps this is an early indicator that people will seek gold as a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. The ICO price of DGD was about 3 dollars, but in 2018, DGD reached an all-time high of over 400 dollars. When Digix finally delivers the DGX tokens and the rewards to DGD participants start rolling in, we might see an even higher demand for DigixDAO. When DGX goes live, it will be available for purchase with Ether on the Digix marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, "yearn-finance-dot": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12791/large/logo_%2815%29.png?1602580328", "rank": 3872, "colors": ["#E31582", "#F42191"], "link": "https://yfdot.finance/", "description": "Yearn Finance Dot platform is powerful enough from a scalability, interoperability, developability and governance perspective to help make the vision of Web3 a reality that aims to get more value for an investment."}, "froge-finance": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14775/large/-p8cz7Bk_400x400.png?1618371907", "rank": 3873, "colors": ["#2B3C4F", "#77A23D"], "link": "https://x.frogefinance.com/", "description": "FrogeX is the direct successor to Froge (EcoDefi token). \r\n\r\nWith Automatic Liquidity posting, Ethereum Dividends for all holders, and gas fees equivalent to DAI and USDT. 5% Buy Tax, 8% Sell Tax.\r\n\r\nDedicated to supporting EcoCharity efforts, FrogeX is backed by the Froge Finance Foundation based in The Hague, Netherlands.\r\n\r\nFrogeX was handcrafted as the first-ever Moonco 1st Generation Contract.

Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum. Additionally, as you would expect from a blockchain-backed application, key information is safely stored and is accessible to everyone with 100% transparency. Except that it now comes secured by a multi-sig authentication system that prevents any type of security breach. According to Aeron's Whitepaper, \"The pilot\u2019s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators\".\r\n\r\nAeron (ARN) is an ERC20 compliant <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> based token, with a fixed supply of 20,000,000 ARN. When the token was launched, a fixed amount of tokens were created and after which no more tokens are to be minted. About 60% of the supply is estimated to be in circulation. The supply should decrease over time when ARN tokens as taken out of circulation. Once Aeron receives ARN tokens in exchange of services, the coins will be again released in to the network.\r\n\r\nAccording to its whitepaper, Aeron plans to have a user base of 300000 by the end of 2020. This would encourage it to embed new features on its platform.\r\nWith the help of multi-app functionality and block technology, the company envisions to have an \u201cairline in the pocket\u201d of sorts within two years.

The global sex market was worth over $ 200 billion in 2021. The potential for growth is huge, because the internet has significantly changed the way in which sex is perceived and how it is experienced. For example, since 1980, the number of men who purchase sexual services has doubled worldwide. In addition to the great potential for the industry, there are also many challenges in the industry for which bitcci is developing unique solutions. Along the value chain of sexual services, we offer sex workers a modern package of services and training programmes marked by free self-determination that ensure their stable and long-term loyalty to the bitcci ecosystem and a high work-life balance. The fact that our IT system is already in operation in the 5 large nightclubs in Switzerland gives us the necessary business data and know-how regarding their needs. The operation of these 5 nightclubs has shown us that there is a considerable need for optimization, modernization, standardization and regulation in the industry.

We\u2019ll use Ethereum smart contracts as the example throughout this whitepaper, but Link is main-chain agnostic and is architected in a manner that is adaptable to the leading smart contract supporting main-chains without a native Web API layer. \r\n\r\nLink solves some of the most persistent and pervasive problems plaguing the blockchain community: ease-of-use and accessibility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in the public consciousness, blockchain still primarily functions as a vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and other financial applications.\r\n\r\nAt Blockmason, we are true blockchain believers \u2014 it is only a matter of time until blockchain spurs the healthcare revolution, empowers economic freedom in developing countries, and stabilizes our fragile mass payment systems. However, it is impossible to realize this beautiful crypto-future until the completion of essential components of blockchain infrastructure. \r\n\r\nBlockchain has a high barrier to entry. From a development perspective, it requires learning Solidity, cryptography APIs, and the nuances of esoteric decentralized systems. From a user perspective, the hesitation is even simpler: decentralized applications are too damn tough to use! In a world that increasingly values convenience, it\u2019s difficult to convince people to increase their DApp usage when usage necessitates so many prerequisites, including creating and learning to use an Ethereum wallet, MetaMask, safely storing your private keys, and so on. Just try explaining to someone the long-term benefits of decentralized contracts when even those in charge of regulating new technologies have no idea how they work. All the public thinks is: why use a \u201csmart contract,\u201d when dumb contracts work just fine? Why use Lndr, when I could use Venmo?\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to one of Blockmason\u2019s core beliefs: for an emerging technology to succeed, it must value the user. For too long, the blockchain community has ignored functionality, in favor of niche technical development, finance, or profit \u2014 hindering mass adoption. This is not to say we don\u2019t love nerdy, precise technical advancement (we do!), but rather that we believe a smooth, exciting user experience is a necessary part of technological growth. \r\n\r\nFully realizing the potential of blockchain technology requires the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Mass adoption requires an enhanced user experience, which itself requires technological innovation. Conversely, any technical breakthrough, regardless of its importance, is squandered if it does not solve the user experience. Greater access to technology leads to greater technological advancement.

It's a user-first dapp platform which makes blockchain based services accessible for first time builders and end users so that everyone can enjoy the increased network transparency, data privacy and reliability that decentralisation offers.\r\n\r\nHow does CENNZnet work?\r\nThe dual token economy\r\nCENNZnet uses a unique dual token system in order to help developers, users and token holders get the best from the network.\r\nCENNZnet has 2 tokens:\r\nCENNZ - the staking token which works separately to block rewards. This means it can increase in value without impacting the cost of using the network. This is important so the price of CENNZ can continue to increase without impacting the amount developers and users pay to use DApps.\r\nCPAY is the gas in the network and is used to pay transaction fees. It is also a block reward payment in staking. It\u2019s designed to be algorithmically stable, so it will retain a steady value. This means developers creating DApps on the network can easily predict the cost of their application, and stakers can easily predict the value of their stake.\r\n\r\nConsensus mechanism: Proof of Stake\r\nCENNZnet uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This is where node operators hold, or stake, their tokens in a particular wallet as collateral against their promise to perform their duties correctly. If they do perform their duties correctly they receive a reward in our CPAY token. If they do not then the staked tokens are slashed, or fined. Other token holders can also stake their tokens against node operators (validators) of their choosing in order to receive a portion of the CPAY reward.\r\nThis system helps to secure the network by incentivising the community to follow protocol and prevent attacks.\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nCENNZnet functions 100% on-chain using blockchain\u2019s built in voting mechanisms. In CENNZnet governance, validators and node operators are required to vote on proposals using a direct voting mechanism (similar to direct democracy) to achieve consensus. Voting results are governed algorithmically and their automatic execution is built directly into the protocol. The winning decisions then automatically integrated into the chain.\r\nCENNZnet pre-built runtime modules\r\nDApp builders have access to core CENNZnet modules which provide the building blocks to common functions required for DApp users.\r\n\r\nNFT\r\nUsing the CENNZnet NFT module users can mint and sell NFTs on CENNZnet without ever needing to touch a smart contract. Instead, they can create custom NFTs using just a Javascript API or point and click with a UI.\r\n\r\nCENNZX\r\nCENNZX is a spot exchange module which enables a seamless fee payment experience on CENNZnet and makes token exchange instant and easy. The CENNZX Spot eliminates rent extraction and centralised services while prioritising decentralisation, usability and security.\r\n\r\nGeneric Asset\r\nGeneric Asset protocol enables CENNZnet\u2019s multicurrency economy. The module allows transaction fees to be paid in any asset, provided there\u2019s liquidity in the CENNZX in-chain GAS exchange. CENNZX will then seamlessly convert the asset into the official gas token, CPAY. This streamlines onboarding and in-app experience by eliminating the need for new users to learn about different token types and simply opting for their favoured currency.\r\n\r\nDoughnut\r\nThe Doughnut module is the secret sauce of the CENNZnet blockchain. Doughnuts are proofs of delegation between two or more cryptographic keypairs. They allow us to prove that one address delegates something to another address and allows permissions and rules to be carried between different networks without the need for a centralised server.

His role is associated with a unique NFT on the Ethereum Blockchain, proving him to be the CEO, which changes from Ethereum address according to who is the new CEO.

The protocol achieves this through constantly analyzing and learning how nodes interact with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nHow Does the CORE Protocol Attract People?\r\n\r\n\u2022Lightweight\r\n\u2022Compatible with the self-interests of each peer, or ability to select the best neighbors\r\n\u2022Robust against adversarial actions: A CORE peer does not need all details about a candidate neighbor to decide whether to connect\r\n\u2022Incentivizes peers to relay blocks promptly.\r\n\u2022Naturally adaptive to varying hash-power\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Multi-Chain is the next generation of blockchain protocol designed to enable legacy, current, and future blockchains to scale and communicate seamlessly. CORE offers a wide variety of possibilities in the blockchain space due to its sharding, interoperability, and central algorithm.\r\nBy providing a fair and secure platform, CORE allows users to regain control over their personal information. The project offers a scalable network featuring functionalities that bypass current blockchain limitations. CORE intends to provide an environment-friendly system that is sustainable, interoperable and provides enhanced throughput. \r\n\r\nHighlights\r\n\u2022Network Efficiency \u2013 CORE contains an AI model at the core of its blockchain. This AI Model speeds up the network\u2019s collective transaction processing times and also enables the network to operate under attacks or faults. \r\n\u2022Security \u2013 The AI model helps coordinate the nodes on the network while also strengthening security on the CORE blockchain. This is accomplished through the network\u2019s outlier detection protocol, which monitors for unusual behavior. The AI randomly selects nodes to test and gather data, monitoring network activity outside of the norm. In this phase, any corrupt nodes will be identified. \r\n\u2022Transaction Privacy Protection Layer: CORE transaction privacy protection layer (TPPL) adds an extra layer of security and privacy when transacting on its blockchain. This universal layer is applied to every CORE-connected chain and can be applied to the major public blockchains.\r\n\u2022Randomness \u2013 The CORE Multi-Chain network combines Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) into a single hybrid solution, thus achieving true Randomness within the network. Randomness influences the difficulty in the mining function of PoW blockchains and periodically chooses the validators in a PoS blockchain.\r\n\u2022Scalability \u2013 To address the scalability issue of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, CORE enhanced the consensus mechanism by reducing the communication complexity within standard PBFT implementations to create the Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nToken Usage\r\n\u2022Through the CMCX token, users can conduct transactions on the CORE blockchain and pay for all utility fees within the ecosystem. Platform users can use the token to participate in governance, stake, transactions, smart contracts, and reward validators.\r\n\u2022Core\u2019s mission is to serve the community. Users can vote for management and developer teams using the native token CORE (CMCX). The CORE community provides projects funding. Users will vote on any proposed changes to the blockchain or platform, creating a community-driven blockchain.\r\n\u2022Through CORE, all blockchains, past and present, will be able to scale and communicate seamlessly with one another by utilizing the CMCX token. \r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-Layered framework design: \r\nCORE is constructed over three layers; ORIGO, CATENA & AURA. Each layer is designed perfectly to get the job done.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGO is the network layer. It is the brain of the system. It handles the formation of the blocks in the blockchain. \r\nCATENA is the blockchain layer and is built on the network layer. This is where the actual blocks form and newly formed blocks are appended.\r\nAURA is the application layer; this is where the DApps and smart contracts are built. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApeirogon blockchain framework\r\nCORE Blockchain combines all the latest frameworks and advanced programming languages into one cutting-edge solution to get more technical. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is built on our in-house Apeirogon blockchain framework, a next-generation framework for enterprise-grade blockchain innovation that is highly compatible with Solidity.\r\nApeirogon is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), a super-performant virtual environment that provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed.\r\nApeirogon\u2019s ecosystem uses a state-of-the-art peer-to-peer network platform called LibP2P, a modular system of protocols, specifications, and libraries that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications and is positioned to be the standard for future decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n Advantages\r\n\u2022Extensive research & value proposition to current blockchain limitations: The Whitepaper available on the Multi-chain website provides an in-depth yet accessible presentation of the responses provided by the team to solve current limitations on scalability, network efficiency, overall security, and reward fairness. CORE Multi-Chain Whitepaper accessible here.\r\n\u2022Security audits available: An audit of the network performed by CERTIK is currently public on the CORE Multi-Chain website. This research documents the project\u2019s performance in the following criteria: Security, Runtime, Documentation, Testing, General, and Transparency.

Existing blockchain file storage technologies such as Filecoin and Storj are very secure ... but also very slow with access latencies of 10 seconds or more. This is not suitable for the vast majority of todays cloud storage applications that demand real-time performance (ie: access latency < 200 microseconds). The only application that blockchain storage is suitable for is for large file batch back-up which is a relatively small market < $300M / year. While decentralization dramatically improves security and privacy, storing files on the blockchain is simply to slow for most consumer and business markets.\r\n\r\nInstead of storing files on the blockchain Cryptyk stores files on a decentralized multi-cloud platform that offers 100x the security of centralized storage (eg: G Drive or iCloud) but without sacrificing access latency ((< 200 microseconds). Files are first encrypted, split into 5 separate file pieces and then each piece is encrypted a second time. Then each doubly encrypted file pieces is stores separately across the 5 major centralized storage providers in Google, Amazon, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft. Cryptyk then integrates this decentralized multi-cloud with a blockchain security auditing platform that permanently stores and tracks every user access event and file editing or sharing event on the blockchain. The blockchain security auditing platform is powered by Cryptyk Tokens (CTK) that are automatically  acquired by cloud storage users who pay in fiat (USD or Euro) with a portion converted into CTK Tokens to pay for security auditing functions. Hence CTK is a true utility token.\r\n\r\nThe result is a hybrid decentralized cloud design that offers the speed and scalability of the major centralized cloud vendors, the security and privacy of a 100% decentralized design, and the immutable permanence of blockchain for auditing and tracking capabilities. Cryptyk's crypto powered cloud storage platform represents the first decentralized technology that can truly compete head-on with centralized vendors like Google or Amazon."}, "csr": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/25585/large/CSR-LOGO-200x200-1.png?1652767956", "rank": null, "colors": ["#7C3A8E", "#BC3371"], "link": "https://csrnow.com/", "description": "CSR \"\"Plastic Credit\"\" is set to follow in the footsteps of the \u201cCarbon Credit\u201d.

CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core. Blockchain is the essence of a variety of technology integration into a State of a synchronous Machine (State Machine), using the characteristics of block chain technology to solve problems which cannot be solved in a traditional network. CyberVein also need to fully consider the model in the process of economics, architecture of applied mathematics, computer hardware and software technology. Its main purpose is to use the block chain technology to successfully serve the problem solving product/platform (BASS).\r\n\r\nThrough the analysis of the problems encountered in the design process of the existing blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to these problems. CyberVein is a underlying framework based on DAG and contains a programming language, the virtual machine, new smart contracts to build ecological chain system, the underlying blocks dedicated to and from the aspects of technical level and business level to solve the problem from the data value of the information age.\r\n\r\nThe business logic of CyberVein\r\n1. The value of passive data: passive data (such as Cookies) is not valuable in itself and only has the value to be exchanged.\r\n2. Definition of data exchange value: the exchange value of data needs to be defined by carrier and medium, which can be quantified to define data value and realize data transfer.\r\n3. The ownership of data: data is different from the ownership of the property rights and intellectual property rights. Data ownership is fundamentally to dominate the process of data, it can define the data owner distributing the data in detail, the capability of sharing, and delivered to the other party; At the same time, data ownership can also define the rights of data owners and tripartite users to create, edit, modify, share, and restrict access to data.\r\nThe three characteristics of CyberVein in the design of deep understanding and mining data can only improve the ecology of data value discovery.\r\n\r\nThe technical solutions of CyberVein\r\nCyberVein has the following technologies and innovative solutions proposed by multiple analysis to realize the design goal of CyberVein.\r\n1.A distributed ledger of DAG architecture.\r\n2.A smart contract programming language improved by CyberVein and a database virtual machine. \r\n3.A new consensus mechanism - PoC (Proof of Contribution)\r\n4.A new, inter-ecological smart contract architecture.\r\nOn the value of the data found in the process of using a DAG architecture of distributed books and a virtual machine with database functions, anyone can write the database and release smart contracts and Dapp, thus they can develop the data ownership of their value, data exchange format and data conversion function of rules.\r\n\r\nCyberVein programming language and virtual machine\r\nIn order to better achieve our smart contract outstanding performance, there are differences to the existing blockchain smart contracts. CyberVein will be in the development of the network at the same time, develop our own programming language Vein and Virtual Machine CBVM (CyberVein Virtual Machine). Vein language will take the Solidity as the foundation, at the same time, to improve the running mechanism with the help of some rich libraries about database operations, realize functions such as definition method call price. \r\nVein language will help in the existing smart contract writers blockchain migration, and CyberVein will release documents to help developers get started faster.\r\nCBVM defines the data value in ecological and metastasis, and provide safe and reliable high-performance smart contracts running environment. CyberVein virtual machine in addition to used to run the smart contract, will also be a database operation system. Unlike traditional database, the database in CBVM sandbox is more like a database, and the operation of each node of the virtual machine will have independent sandbox, ensure data or use condition does not affect chain is affected.\r\n\r\nCyberVein new consensus algorithm: Proof of Contribution\r\nCyberVein, like all blockchain technology, is driven by motivation of safe mode. In the traditional blockchain mining consensus, it is based on the choice of total difficulty of highest blocks. Miners and others to the blocks. In most of the consensus standards, only containing a given difficulty of work experience (PoW) of blocks are valid.\r\nThere\u2019s no mining mechanism in the DAG architecture because there is no miner concept. However, the existing DAG in the project before the release unit verification, most are using PoW and CyberVein will use our PoC mechanism is put forward.\r\nCyberVein contribution to prove: a response to block in the chain of the abuse of power or force concentrated and algorithm. PoC is based on the user's contribution to the network, add the appropriate hash calculation, to determine whether can win in the competition mechanism in the network. In traditional blockchain PoC can be used in the process of mining.\r\nIn each have the same hash miners work force, contribute more to the network resources miners (such as he contributed more hard disk capacity, or bandwidth, or power, etc.) will have smaller hash difficulty, so as to have more chance to beat competitors in the probability, acquired the right to the manufacture of new blocks.\r\nIn the DAG, when a user has more units under the condition of (he contributed more hard disk storage unit in the network), it will be more likely to reference the existing units, and obtain the corresponding fees.\r\nIOTA and Byteball projects in PoW validation of the role is mainly used to prevent the witch attacks and network to some extent abuse problems, and we believe that the use of PoC and other mechanisms, and can be done at the same time, encourage more users to participate in and contribution to the attack of prevention effect."}, "cyclone-protocol": {"link": "https://cyclone.xyz/", "description": "Cyclone is a multi-chain, non-custodial, privacy-preserving protocol.

To do so, GAMB uses a proprietary parallel chain system by creating a \u201cclone\u201d coin (GMBT) on the SkyFiber blockchain, to its publicly traded ECR-20 parent token (GMB). GMB and its parallel clone are the native tokens of GLMall. This revolutionary and patent-pending parallel token solution allows crypto payments without any blockchain-related transfer or gas fees and is the key to implementing crypto payments in daily e-commerce. \r\n\r\nWhy should I buy GMB?\r\nBy being a GMB holder you will be part of the first decentralized online marketplace operating in the real world and the metaverse. GMB is easily swappable into its parallel coin GMBT which can be used to purchase goods or services on the marketplace without any fees. \r\n\r\nHow many GMB are in circulation?\r\nAll of 5.000.000.000 GMB created have been created and issued, along with the same number of clone tokens GMBT.\r\n\r\nWhat makes GMB so unique?\r\nGAMB\u2019s unique parallel chain solution allows transactions to be completely free, infinitely scalable. For any one active GMBT coin used for transactions on the marketplace (i.e., within the SkyFiber blockchain), one GMB token is locked on the ETH blockchain until a re-swap occurs. This directly limiting impact on GMB liquidity on the ETH blockchain, created through the increased utilization of the GMBT on the Marketplace, forms an organically value-driving token economy. \r\n\r\nWhat is the technical basis of GMB/GMBT?\r\nGMB is an ECR 20 Token and a licensed utility token. Its parallel clone GMBT's is built on the Skyfiber blockchain using its unique consensus algorithm called \"\"Obelisk\"\". Obelisk consensus mechanism uses a PoT (Proof-of-Trust) consensus algorithm which establishes a unique validation mechanism modeled on a 'web of trust' topography and distributing influence across the network in a manner reminiscent of human social dynamics. Every node has a list of trusted nodes to which it subscribes to and the more subscribers a node has, the more influence it has on the network. Due to the transparent and public nature of the decisions and trust lists located on each node's individual blockchain, a misbehaving node can easily be identified and isolated by the community as nodes will simply remove the malicious node from their trust list, causing the node's influence to decrease. This mechanism allows the community to shift the balance of power on the network rapidly which brings about a highly democratic and decentralized decisioning process.\r\n\r\nWhere can I buy GMB?\r\nGMB tokens can be purchased on most KuCoin, Coinsbit & Azbit and provides four trading pairs BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT.\r\n\r\nMost recent articles about GAMB:\r\nhttps://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=content/view&id=40813\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSDIqmoFcuo&t=1279s \r\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-cinematic-nft-film-series-135800667.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr \r\n"}, "gambler-shiba": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/17130/large/RHzOHCyb_400x400.jpg?1626410775", "rank": null, "colors": ["#E00B12", "#B49293"], "link": "", "description": "Gambler Shiba (GSHIBA) is The first perfect gambling token to give fair rewards to holders based on their commitment to GSHIBA.\r\n\r\nWe provide a tiered gambling system, the higher tier you're in, the more rewards, you get.

Each GPO token represents an option to purchase 1 newly minted GPX token at spot gold price + 1%.\r\n\r\n**What Is GoldPesa (GPX)?**\r\nThe GPX token has been designed to act as a hybrid token, initially minted and sold at spot gold price + 1%. Hybrid tokens are generally pegged to other assets or currencies. They are collateralised and float in price with an expected premium, due to the earnings aspect of the GPX token.\r\n1 GPX is ultimately backed by 1 gram of physical gold. GPX tokens are directly backed by Paxos Gold (\u201cPAXG\u201d) which are stored in a decentralised smart contract.\r\nThis ensures users that their underlying digital assets (PAXG) are secured in a decentralised and trustless manner on the blockchain and that no central body, authority, government or even GoldPesa has access to GoldPesa token holders' underlying digital assets.\r\n\r\n**How Can A Gold-Backed Token Trade At A Premium?**\r\nGoldPesa invests 50% of all fees in a brokerage account managed by the PAWN, a proprietary and highly intelligent trading algorithm.\r\nProfits generated by the PAWN are used to buy back and then burn GPX tokens from the market, which rewards token holders by creating demand and reducing supply at the same time.\r\nThis model effectively creates earnings on an asset class (gold) that generally does not have any earnings. Based on traditional finance, by creating earnings, we can expect the market to trade GPX at some multiple of the earnings and therefore will result in GPX being traded at a premium depending on the performance of the Pawn, our proprietary and highly intelligent trading algorithm.\r\nIt's important to note that GPX token holder's gold remains unencumbered at all times as we risk our own fees/capital for the benefit of token holders, resulting in tokens which have the characteristics of a DeFi gold-backed structured product.\r\nAs GPX begins to trade at a premium, the intrinsic value of the GoldPesa Option token (GPO) will also increase naturally as it is correlated to the premium of GPX.\r\n\r\n**GPX Token Minting**\r\nGoldPesa Option (GPO) holders have the ability to exercise their option and purchase newly minted GPX tokens by wrapping their Paxos Gold token (PAXG) along with the GoldPesa Option token (GPO) together into a smart contract which will custodian the token holders underlying asset (PAXG) in a secure, trustless and decentralised manner while simultaneously burning the GPO tokens and removing them from circulation.\r\nThe smart contract automatically mints new GPX tokens and delivers them to the token holder's wallet for a 1% fee.\r\n\r\n**GPX Secondary Market**\r\nOnce minted, GPX tokens will be available on a number of decentralised and centralised exchanges where investors can purchase it in the secondary market at an expected premium depending on the performance of the PAWN, our proprietary intelligent trading algorithm.\r\n\r\n**How many GPO tokens are there in circulation?**\r\nGPO launched on the Ethereum MainNet on Oct 12, 2021 with a hard cap of 100 million GPO tokens created at genesis. GPO also has a wallet hard cap of 100,000 GPO per wallet.\r\n\r\n**Who Are The Founders Of GoldPesa?**\r\nGoldPesa is the brainchild of developer and computer engineer Shamik Raja who has extensive experience in digital signal processing, programming, commodities and quantitative science.\r\nBetween 2001 and 2006, Raja earned a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia in Canada. Over the years Raja has focused on research involving the application of principals in digital signal processing to create an automated commodity-buying system that uses algorithmic calculations to navigate complex international commodity and currency markets.\r\nGoldPesa is an amalgamation of Raja\u2019s 8 years experience in the precious metals sector combined with over 20 years experience in quantitative science and engineering.\r\n\r\n**Where Can I Buy GPO?**\r\nGPO can be purchased on the [GoldPesa](https://app.goldpesa.com/) decentralised exchange power by Uniswap.\r\nGoldPesa has coded an advanced dynamic liquidity protocol, using Uniswap V3. The code places liquidity in concentrated ranges which rebalance automatically based on machine learning models, resulting in steady growth, price protection and lower slippage."}, "gomics": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9506/large/69581895_377122223186787_4719544883591774208_n.png?1568184472", "rank": null, "colors": ["#D22222", "#EA9D9D"], "link": "http://gomics.io/", "description": "Gomics intends to build a platform for writers and fans to take advantages of blockchain technology in the production and consumption of content.

While fans are arguably the single most indispensable party to this equation, they are the lowest on the totem pole when it comes to ownership by an order of magnitude or higher.Web3 changes all that by consumerizing ownership. With web3, consumers finally have the capability to collectively own and coordinate at scale.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\nPhase 1: Shootaround\r\nPhase 2: Scrimmage\r\nPhase 3: Gametime\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Shootaround\r\nTicket Holders will include contributors, fans, patrons, influencers, and athletes, each with different skills and wants. Thus, we are creating a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d model where different types of participation earn NFTs. These NFTs will form collections that unlock additional benefits. Building, hanging out, attending events, buying merch, and competitions will each offer their own NFTs. These could include jerseys, trophies, kicks, or headbands. Earned NFTs will have unique perks and designs, and different seasons offer limited editions. Perks could include merch drops, NBA tickets, and lessons with elite coaches. \r\n\r\nPhase 2: Scrimmage\r\nRushing to place a bid on an NBA team without success running other organizations as a DAO will likely force decision making to centralize and sideline the community. Thus, we need to demonstrate success operating as a collective intelligence.\r\n\r\nOur strategy is two-pronged.\r\n\r\nOne, pursue teams to run franchises in parallel. We plan to launch bids on multiple smaller franchises to learn by doing and demonstrate success. This will likely involve ventures into multiple sports in multiple countries (we\u2019ve had plenty of excitement from football fans). This allows us to experiment in our approach and learn, without a single point of failure. Note, we will not necessarily need to purchase a majority (or even a minority) stake in these teams, as we can act (and have been approached) as a service DAO. We also want to collaborate with non-Krause House individuals and DAOs looking to buy a team as well in an effort to learn and share knowledge.\r\n\r\nTwo, empower these teams with the tooling, network, and knowledge they need. DAO framework and decision making tooling is rapidly progressing; however, we can both fund and contribute to tooling that we will need to govern franchises. We view this effort as inevitably collaborative with other DAOs, given the common limitations faced.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Gametime\r\nWith demonstrated success running a portfolio of smaller cap franchises, we believe that the NBA will approve our bid to officially acquire a majority position in an NBA team. We will raise additional capital to put forth either a bid on an NBA team. The legal structures and rights of token holders will be determined based on NBA regulations at that time.\r\n\r\nYet, our journey is not over post-ownership. We have many championship banners to raise in the Krause House. At this point, we have the option to burn IRL trophies and mint them as NFTs, which can be decided collectively"}, "kronn": {"link": "https://kronn.net/", "description": "KRONN Exchange System aims to provide a robust and reliable service to their users for allowing real-time Fiat and Crypto exchange."}, "kryptopets": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/23337/large/kyTyD2Fi_400x400.jpg?1643882890", "rank": null, "colors": ["#7A361A", "#BD5B0D"], "link": "https://kryptopetsmetaverse.com/", "description": "$KPETS is an ERC-20 based token focused on establishing the Kryptopets Metaverse - an NFT based Play-To-Earn blockchain-game.

As a decentralized scalable layer 1 chain based on patented technologies, Locus Chain aims to support various Defi, GameFi, Metaverse, Smart City, CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency) projects by being the most reliable, secure, low cost and high performance layer 1 public blockchain platform. Locus Chain claims to be the first decentralized Layer 1 public blockchain to ever solve the blockchain trilemma of Decentralization. Scalability and Security.\r\n\r\nLOCUS token?\r\nThe current Locus token type before the mainnet is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token with smart contract issued by Locus Chain Foundation. However, given that the tokens on the public Ethereum network cannot be used on the Locus Chain directly, we will be making use of hashed time-locked contracts to allow 1-to-1 atomic swaps of Locus tokens from Ethereum to the Locus Chain mainnet. LOCUS will be the main cryptocurrency required for all the operations of the Locus Chain network and all of its applications. LOCUS is a payment method for the entire network economy. Tokens are used by validators (who can easily participate), developers, and users to participate in the LOCUS network and receive rewards. It is also used to for fees and to participate in future governance.\r\n\r\nLOCUS Ecosystem\r\nTop developers and high profile business partners are participating in the development of Locus Chain one after another. High-performance Layer 1 blockchain can create various business opportunities in sectors including decentralized finance, real estate transaction platforms, and game money, etc as well as creating various other tokens. In addition, Locus Chain allows the users to use the blockchain verification service through a simple linkage without building a separate blockchain. Since it is a high-performance public blockchain platform, technology licensing will be carried out in the future in the areas of CBDC and IOT, including smart cities, smart factories, and smart grids based on vast amounts of data.\r\n\r\nSpecial technology of LOCUS\r\n*DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) - AWTC(Account-Wise Transaction Chain)\r\n\r\nThe AWTC, Account-Wise-Transaction-Chain, is a central data structure for Locus Chain's high capacity, distributed transaction processing. AWTC is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) based data structure composed of multiple transaction chains, each for an account. Each account has its dedicated chain. A new transaction issued by an account is primarily added to the account's chain. Block grid structures, including DAG-AWTC, do not cause conflicts because there are as many points as the number of accounts to which the transaction is added, and only the owning account can record it exclusively. Also, the account that added the transaction becomes clear, so if the account holder himself is not a malicious user, the transaction is almost confirmed as soon as it is added. The ledger structure of the Locus Chain is one of the main technical features to fundamentally solve the problem of delayed transaction processing that the existing blockchains had.\r\n\r\nPOS - BFT Consensus Algorithm\r\nGiven the time required for the data to propagate sufficiently to the network, the Locus Chain first implemented a BFT definitive consensus on the DAG by attempting to consent on a small amount of historical points of time. It also selects a new proposer committee that participates in the consensus algorithm every round by a random verifiable function (VRF) based on stochastic PoS (proof of stake: the more shares, the higher the probability of being elected as a committee). Since these methods cannot identify or predict the nodes (proposer, validator) to participate in the consensus, manipulation by malicious attacks is difficult, ensuring fairness and network stability of the consensus results.\r\n*Verifiable Pruning\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional pruning, which reduces the size of a ledger by simply deleting old data to address growing ledger sizes, Locus Chain's Verifiable Pruninng uses a Skewed Merkle Tree structure to validate the legitimacy of the data even when most of the previous data is deleted in the local environment. Verifiable pruning deletes outdated data on the ledger while still being able to provide full data verification by verifying previous data with hash values.\r\n\r\n*Dynamic Sharding\r\n\r\nLocus Chain has a ledger structure formed of each account (AWTC), making it easy to adjust the number and size of the shard, and the validator ratio by relocating the shard in the event of an imbalance between shards. With dynamic sharding, the network usage that a node has to cover is reduced to 2/N when the number of shards is N. The total network TPS for network usage on the same node will increase by that amount, plus the additional ledger state sharding, which will also divide the storage usage by the number of shards.\r\n\r\nLOCUS\u2019S creators\r\nThe key development members of the Locus Chain were developers of the Blueside Engine, Korea's first commercial game engine. The core of Locus Chain technology is to effectively process and synchronize large amounts of network traffic. The developers of Blueside Engine have acquired 18 software development related intellectual property rights, which are the product of the technology accumulated through console/online games and software development over the past 20 years, and hold 2 other software patents.\""}, "logitron": {"link": "https://logitron.io", "description": "\"LogiTron helps you build your own meta world on the blockchain ecosystem.

That combines the additive growth effect of a hyper inflationary token without the holder value dilution that usually follows such a practice. $MeM is able to escape the dilutive effects of inflation by having the inflation only occur on the mint of taxed tokens. This ensures that a user's value does not remain antithetic to the rate of inflation but instead grows along side it in direct proportion to it. \r\n\r\n$MeM is a Pump-as-a-service (PaaS) IaaS/ FaaS project. Utilizing the taxed value to commit to buying back the tokens and burning the supply to slowly raise the price floor.\r\nEach $MeM token acts as an individuals share of the profits pumped back into the token supply by the treasury.\r\n$MeM is a user specific, stable-inflation rate, reflection token. What that means is that whatever % of the total supply you purchase at any given time you will keep for the remainder of the time you hold the token. New tokens are minted from the taxes and are distributed to all current holders; this neutralizes the potential for holder bag dilution from inflation. Since every holder\u2019s bag grows in direct proportion to the rate of inflation. The beneficial effect of having \u201creflations\u201d is that a holder\u2019s bag EXPONENTIALLY increases in value as the taxes mint new tokens. A .01% holder goes from holding .01% of 1T tokens to holding .01% of 10T tokens over time. So regardless of how much of the token you have you are guaranteed to gain an adequate amount of reflections; a magical solution to the holder distribution issue that many reflection tokens suffer from.\r\nPaaS/ Iaas\r\nThe $MeM token will be utilizing funds generated by the taxes to perform one function: distributing the collected funds to holders still in the $MeM system. The primary mode by which this will be accomplished is through a buy and burn mechanism. All tokens that are bought by the treasury will be sent to a burn address to reduce the circulating supply and steadily raise the token price floor.

The MCO Token Sale was conducted in May-June 2017 and raised US$26.7 million. \r\n\r\nMCO Card is a Visa-branded debit card that draws from a cryptocurrency-funded bank account. Since it\u2019s a Visa card, you can use your MCO Visa card just like you would any other card. The card and bank account are free for holders of cryptocurrency. In order to open an account, you simply sign up, verify your identity, and transfer any of the various accepted cryptocurrencies to your account. At this time, the Visa card is available to customers in Asia. They also have a waitlist for European customers. Customers in the United States does not have access to it at the moment. However, there are plans to change that. Solving the problem of everyday payments has the potential to be huge for cryptocurrency. However, MCO Visa card is not the only project attempting to create crypto-backed debit (or prepaid) cards. Other projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tenx\">TenX</a>, are working on the same issue. All of these projects run into challenges implementing such cards in a large scale, compliant manner. Crypto.com hopes to crack the code, ultimately getting cryptocurrencies and popular payment methods to play nicely together.\r\n\r\nCrypto.com was founded in June 2016 in Switzerland and rebranded from Monaco on 6th July 2018. Their first prototype was developed in October of that year. In February of 2017, they were accepted into a Hong Kong Government backed Cyberport incubation program, where they developed their platform until they were ready to launch their token sale in 2017. The sale closed in June with $26.7 million in funding. Their app became available to pre-registered users in August 2017, followed by the official partnership with Visa in October. The team consists of seasoned veterans in the fin-tech space, most of whom have experience in Asia, where Monaco Cards have first been made available.\r\n\r\nSince MCO Visa cards are backed by cryptocurrency, they don\u2019t have border issues like fiat currencies. As a result, you can use your card anywhere you go. The card will automatically default to the local fiat currency when you make a purchase. The low fees and exchange rates also apply in other countries. Transactions take place at the exact exchange rate that Crypto.com receives as an institutional trader. In contrast, when you use your debit card across borders with most banks, they\u2019ll add an additional percentage to the exchange rate or include a transaction fee. Crypto.com has connections with eight of the top ten international foreign exchange banks to facilitate currency conversion.\r\n\r\nThe MCO Visa card is a compelling option for anyone looking to make everyday purchases with cryptocurrency. It also makes sense for cross-border travelers. However, we can expect the rollout to take a long time and hit a lot of bumps along the way. The financial industry is highly regulated and cryptocurrency-backed payments is a complex issue, even if Crypto.com's solution seems to make it simple and user-friendly."}, "monastery-finance": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24563/large/s0vLTcH.png?1648189796", "rank": null, "colors": ["#4B4F15", "#ABB30A"], "link": "https://monastery.finance", "description": "We're an OHM fork built on the ethereum network and the Monastery (MONK) token is the main token of our DAO protocol.

The process uses economic incentives and rewards funded from 7.5% of the final payout of any auction which uses the NIFTY protocol. The reward is distributed to a pool of \u201cendorsers\u201d or \u201cadvocates\u201d in proportion to each token holder's respective endorsement allocation amount, in NFTY tokens, to auctions on NFT exchanges which support the protocol. \r\n\r\nThis incentive gives the participants the challenge of defining the best strategy to \u201cendorse\u201d auctions based on their ability to close the sale, possible amount of the final payout, quality of the NFT being auctioned, and the number of other advocates currently endorsing the auction. The reward is distributed proportionally to the social power of all advocates: i.e. if Person A allocates 10 NFTY to an auction and Person B allocates 20 NFTY to it, Person A gets 1/3 of the 7.5% advocacy reward. During an auction's bidding period, allocated NFTY tokens are locked and unable to be unstaked until after that auction is completed and the NFT is sold, at which point allocated NFTY tokens are unlocked for reallocation or unstaking.\r\n\r\nThis creates a multitude of possible strategies without incentivizing the endorsement of non-sellable, low-quality, or fraudulent products and spammy content as doing so is not economically viable. Overall, this acts as a filter and data analytics platform where a user can determine the degree of desirability and expected sale and potential value of an NFT. The token supply has no cap, but can only be increased through staking which yields a 13.579% APR. Staking is required to enable the endorsement/advocacy mechanisms.\""}, "niifi": {"link": "https://www.niifi.com/", "description": "NiiFi is built on patent-pending scaling technology allowing for instant finality, low cost and predictable gas/transaction fees, interoperability, and composability.

ONE holders will receive 100 percent of trading fee on BigONE\u2019s platform.\r\n\r\nONE is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\nCommunity-owned\r\n51% of all ONEs belong to community. The total amount is 10.2 billion. Once mined/released, these ONE tokens can circulate on BigONE.\r\n\r\nBIG token holders owned\r\n49% of all ONEs belong to existing BIG token holders. Total amount of this part is 9.8 billion ONEs, and will be released at the same rate as the community-owned part in proportion. These ONEs will be airdropped to all BIG token holders every day. However, these ONEs airdropped to BIG holders will be frozen till June 21st, 2022 UTC+8, and cannot be circulated on the BigONE trading platform or other platforms during this period.\r\n\r\nTrade cryptos in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section, and get your trading fee rebated in ONEs of the equivalent value.\r\nRefer new users to complete registration, pass identity verification (KYC) on BigONE, and start trading in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section. As incentive, you will receive 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee rebate in the form of ONEs.\r\nBIG tokens stored on BigONE platform will automatically be airdropped ONEs.\r\nHold ONEs, Share All Platform Trading Fee\r\n\r\nEveryday at 00:00 UTC+8, BigONE will take a snapshot according to the current ONE balance on the platform. All trading fee occurred on the platform during the past 24 hours will be airdropped to all ONE holders in the form of a number of crypto assets received by the platform. Allocation formula = number of ONE held / total number of ONE released\r\n\r\nAll ONEs are locked until mined, and will be gradually mined through \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d or \u201cReferral-Mining\u201d or \u201cAirdrop to BIG token holders\u201d until 20 billion ONEs are all mined.\r\n\r\n\u3010Trade-Mining\u3011\r\n\r\nTrade-Mining can only be achieved by trading crypto assets in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the platform will calculate all trading fees occurred in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section during the last 24 hours (from the previous 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) and unlock equivalent worth of ONEs using the average price of ONE on the same day. On the following day\u2019s 10:00 UTC+8, the trading platform will rebate these unlocked ONEs to users / miners who traded in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section in the previous day.\r\n\r\n\u3010Referral-Mining\u3011\r\n\r\nReferral-mining is the incentive mechanism for the platform\u2019s existing users to invite new users to sign up BigONE. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the trading platform will calculate the total trading fee from your referred new users\u2019 tradings on the previous day (from 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) to the equivalent value of ONEs. BigONE will rebate 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee to you in ONE tokens. Such incentive will be given to you on the same day at 10:00 AM UTC+8.\r\n\r\nNote: The ONEs that are referral-mined are released in addition to the regular trade-mined portion, thus BIG token holders will also receive their equivalent proportion of referral-mined ONEs airdropped.\r\n\r\n\u3010Airdrop ONEs to BIG Token Holders\u3011\r\n\r\nEvery midnight (24:00 PM UTC+8) the platform will take a snapshot of the balance of BIG tokens, and airdrop mined ONEs to BIG holders\u2019 according to the formula: [Previous day\u2019s number of unlocked ONEs in the Community-owned part] / 51 x 49]. However, these ONEs given to BIG holders will be frozen until June 21st, 2022, and cannot be circulated on trading platform during this period, but the platform rebates continue to apply.\r\n\r\n\u3010Friendly Tips\u3011\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new \u201cTrade-mining\u201d rule applies and 100% of BigONE's revenue (trading fee) is rebated to ONE holders gradually, the previous BIG buy back scheme will be terminated, because BIG holders will get airdropped ONEs and receive related rebate and incentives.\r\n\r\nONE is a platform token of BigONE and is not traded on other platforms.\r\n\r\nPlease be reminded that crypto assets could be highly volatile with high risks.

Instead of relying on trading fees to grow liquidity, Behodler relies on the tokenomics of SCX to draw liquidity into the AMM. Since SCX is required to redeem liquidity, the ongoing burn of SCX implies a growing portion of permanent liquidity on Behodler. And since the price of SCX equates to the average value  liquidity on Behodler, all incentive structures including yield farming are aimed at increasing the SCX price, either through lockup or incentive backed burning.\r\nUnlike many protocols that seek to silo liquidity, Behodler thrives when working in conjunction with existing AMMs, forming a synergy that opens up opportunities to both yield chasing defi veterans as well as infrequent traders who simply wish to swap for the lowest possible gas cost."}, "scardust": {"link": "https://warmus.land/scardust/", "description": "A comic cryptoverse with a P2E fighting game & animated series, including in-game digital\r\ncollectible trading cards, weapons, wearables, land parcels, and more.\r\nSCARDust has a charitable foundation arm donating to and raising awareness about mental health education, detecting signs, and seeking help.

At its core, SeedSwap is a platform for people to congregate, discuss, learn, and exchange NFT's and other crypto related things. SeedSwap is designed around three main components: SNFT tokens and farming, the SeedSwap NFT exchange, and SeedSwap Social.\r\n\r\nSNFT tokens are the cryptocurrency offered by SeedSwap. No more than 100-million SNFT shall ever exist at once, and not all of the total supply of SNFT will ever be in circulation at one time. The circulating supply level is dictated by two factors: the farming system and the minting of SeedSwap non-fungible tokens. For the farming system, 40-million SNFT have been allocated as rewards for liquidity providers or \"\"farmers\"\". By applying a multiplier to farmers' annual percentage yields, the farming system will see increases to farmers' staking yields over time. Paid in SNFT, farmers will be chiefly responsible for bringing new SeedSwap tokens into circulation. The exact mechanics of the farming system, its rules, and the multipliers are described in the whitepaper, which all farmers are encouraged to read before participating in SeedSwap.\r\n\r\nThe second factor that affects circulating SNFT supply occurs in the SeedSwap NFT exchange. The NFT exchange is a platform that enables its users to create and trade non-fungible tokens. SeedSwap will also offer its own non-fungible tokens which are redeemable with SNFT. Some of the SNFT used to redeem a SeedSwap non-fungible token will be burned or removed from circulation each time this occurs, thus whenever a SeedSwap NFT is created with SNFT it is a deflationary event. The number of SNFT required to redeem a non-fungible token will depend on the rarity of the non-fungible token, being either common, uncommon, rare, or ultra rare. In addition to SeedSwap NFT's, other NFT's can be created and exchanged on the exchange without the need to redeem them with SNFT.\r\n\r\nThe SeedSwap platform also includes a social media component called SeedSwap Social, which will allow users to connect and discuss NFT's and other crypto-related topics. SeedSwap Social is a living accompaniment to the NFT exchange, and aims to host a variety of forms of media and content. By this, it is meant that the platform as a whole will neither be an NFT exchange nor a social media site simply, but both at the same time, facilitating discourse, entertainment, and NFT creation and exchange all from within a single, integrated setting. Through SeedSwap Social, users will be able to discuss and share their favorite non-fungible tokens, creators, and trends, and through the NFT exchange, they will be able to act by exchanging non-fungible tokens or creating their own."}, "seed-venture": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10860/large/Seed.png?1585204998", "rank": null, "colors": ["#016994", "#CA6B00"], "link": "https://seedventure.io", "description": "Seed Venture is a platform for crowdfunding of startup pools, which allows issuing, crowdfunding and trading of pool tokens.

Bringing nearly 30 years of history to the blockchain, whilst boasting an established community of avid and dedicated fans has led industry giants DAO Maker and Shima Capital to support the project as leading investors. Physical cards have a digital state, where some feature voice or gesture-empowered actions to create unique interactions for gamers avoiding age barriers, geo limits, and technology gaps.

Digital and physical cards are connected through a QR code printed on the back of each card, making them traceable, upgradable, and playable online and offline. The game connects three realities together - the Physical, the Digital and the Augmented reality. Ensuring that no one gets left behind, Spellfire is going multichain, making it one of the first to support multi chain NFTs.

Currently, there is no single platform that can unite all the fans with their favorite teams and provide a platform to engage, entertain and experience privileged contents and activities that is currently available for only a selected few. Some of the issues that fans face currently include, but not limited to, low engagement, lack of incentivization and limited powers as fans etc.\r\n\r\nUsing Sportzchain\u2019s platform, we aim to bridge the gap between fans and their favorite sporting teams. Our vision is to create a single window for the sporting fraternity that would eliminate the current hurdles for fans and bring them closer to the teams they support and convert it to a long-lasting relationship, wherein fans and teams can both contribute to and benefit from each other. In other words, our platform will be a Digital World for Fans and our native asset $SPN will be at the core of this world\u2019s engine and will be interoperable across our ecosystem. \r\n\r\nCurrently we have a exclusive sports token and NFT partnership with 5+ teams in Cricket and Kabaddi (a renowned sports in India).

All activities including buying sports tokens of your favorite team, participating in polls and contests, accessing exclusive and VIP privileges, enjoying \u2018money cant buy\u2019 experiences will require you to hold $SPN tokens. To summarize, with $SPN constituting the core of our platform functions, we believe we will deliver high engagement and financial rewards for the token holders over the short, medium and long terms. For early adopters of $SPN, we will provide staking programs with up to 40% APY providing passive income for hodlers of $SPN.\r\n\r\nThe total supply of $SPN is 10 Billion and expected to be launched on various DEX and CEX on por before June 2022.

The team\u2019s aim is to turn Supercats into one the biggest and most  respected projects of 2022 and beyond. Past experience has shown us just how powerful cat meme coins can be. Not only will this project bring you amazing utility and use case, but Supercats will be known for years to come as the superhero to many struggling projects.   Supercats will be launching on the  31st of July 2022 with the mission to conquer the world of crypto. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nMISSION STATEMENT \r\nThe Supercats team holds the following values dear to its heart and at the core they represent who we are: \r\nCommunity \u2013 \r\nWorking collaboratively with the community is at the heart of our work. Because, when people come together, we can accomplish so much more than we ever could alone. \r\n  \r\nIntegrity and Accountability  \r\nWe deeply value the trust that the community has placed in us, and we work tirelessly to ensure that this trust will always be well founded \r\n  \r\nTransparency \r\nAt Supercats the team always encourages open communication between the team and the community members.  This transparent and open dialogue is one of the strongest of our pillars and works on trust within the community to go the distance. \r\n \r\nVALUATION \r\nIn traditional business practices, the value of an asset is determined by factors such as risk, cost of operations and other determinants of growth.  Over the years and with the rise of the Dotcom era, especially in the meme coin realm,  other factors such as hype and community surpasses these traditional valuations.  \r\nSupercats aim, as you take this journey with us,  will be to gain your trust and belief in the project and its value. As this is accomplished with the amazing reach and brand recognition, this will become a self-fulfilling prophecy for the team and you as our community.

The platform allows practically unlimited external compute resources to be applied in a trusted way to extend the performance, throughput, and scalability of its host blockchain. Research began in 2015 on this verification solution which today connects blockchains to both on-chain and off-chain data while enabling smart contracts to securely perform complex computations in standard, easy-to-use programming languages at significantly reduced gas costs. \r\n\r\nUnlike sharding and other methods for distributing high transaction throughput, Truebit processes complex and large transactions via a consensus mechanism involving a minimal number of redundancies, making it a novel solution for Web 3.0 infrastructure. The bulk of computation occurs with off-chain resources.\r\n \r\nVerifier\u2019s Dilemma - What Makes Truebit Unique?\r\n \r\nRather than relying on external, cryptographic proofs of correctness, Truebit brings scalable computation to blockchains by leveraging game theory principles and financial incentives to increase the on-chain computation power of existing networks and reduce marginal gas costs.\r\n \r\nWhile smart contracts can perform small computations correctly, large computation tasks pose security risks for blockchains due to the Verifier's Dilemma. Truebit counteracts this via a retrofitting oracle that achieves correct computational results. Truebit\u2019s microeconomy ensures trustless verification through a financial incentive layer atop a dispute resolution layer.\r\n \r\nWho is the founder of Truebit (TRU)?\r\n \r\nTruebit was founded by mathematician and computer scientist Jason Teutsch who co-authored the whitepaper with Ethereum\u2019s Solidity creator and team lead, Christian Reitwiessner. Jason holds a PhD in Mathematics, was a two-time US Fulbright Fellow, and co-discovered the Verifier\u2019s Dilemma.\r\n \r\nApplications\r\n\r\nApplications include:\r\nLayer-2 settlements \r\nDeFi settlements and bookkeeping\r\nBatch verification of cryptographic signatures\r\nChecking proof-of-work\r\nPerforming operation(s) with high computational complexity\r\n \r\nAny smart contract can issue a computation task to Truebit in standard languages (C, C++, or Rust) without concern for Ethereum\u2019s gas limit. Truebit\u2019s WebAssembly-based architecture can read functions and data from Ethereum bytes, smart contract program code, or IPFS.\r\n \r\nWhat kind of token is Truebit (TRU)?\r\n \r\nThe supply of TRU tokens may fluctuate over time.  \r\n \r\nLearn more about Truebit:\r\n \r\nGetting started with Truebit on Ethereum  \r\nhttps://medium.com/truebit/getting-started-with-truebit-on-ethereum-ac1c7cdb0907\r\nAn Intro to TrueBit: A Scalable, Decentralized Computational Court   https://medium.com/@simondlr/an-intro-to-truebit-a-scalable-decentralized-computational-court-1475531400c3\r\n \r\nLearn more about Ethereum:\r\nEthereum\r\nhttps://ethereum.org/en/"}, "truefeedbackchain": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8842/large/5rd7a55q_400x400.png?1562902557", "rank": null, "colors": ["#595959", "#EAB921"], "link": "https://www.truefeedback.io/", "description": "TrueFeedBack is a survey/bounty platform where companies, institutions, academicians or other interested parties can create surveys or bounties.

It aims to become a truly decentralized currency, backed by yield-generating digital and growth assets, governed on the blockchain and led by industry leading experts. \r\n\r\nWhat does United DAO seek to achieve? \r\nUnited DAO's vision is to build a DAO-led decentralized protocol that is accessible to all as a store of value.\r\nUnited DAO seeks to usher in the new age of DeFi 3.0 through Establishing True Credibility, Strong On-chain Governance and Active Risk Management for our stakeholders. We also seek to reduce price volatility by introducing innovative new tokenomics to our native token model, which would align long-term investors with our project, and a burning mechanism for our tokens in order to reduce the overall token supply. \r\n\r\nWhat is United DAO's unique value proposition?\r\nUnited DAO\u2019s Core Protocol establishes two primary strategies for market participants: staking and bonding. Stakers stake their UTD tokens in return for more UTD tokens, while bonders provide LP or USDC in exchange for discounted UTD tokens after a fixed vesting period. \r\nThe Core Protocol is underpinned by three unique propositions - United Allies Program, Rewards & Utility Program, and Treasury Management \u2013 along with strong enablers. \r\nUnited DAO was founded by an experienced, versatile team with wide-ranging experiences - spanning blockchain, economics, finance, and more. This provides a strong foundation for the protocol's build, while maintaining an end vision of having a completely DAO-led protocol.\r\n\r\nHow can I benefit from United DAO? \r\nYou can benefit from United DAO's Core Protocol by becoming a staker or bonder. \r\n\r\nStaker: The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new UTD tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.\r\nBonder: The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in UTD and thus the bonder\u2019s profit would depend on UTD price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static UTD price. \r\nParticipants also benefit from United DAO's three other propositions:\r\nUnited Allies Program: The Program is designed to enable growing and building the community and the Treasury. Core features of the Program include a unique pledging mechanism, along with an innovative affiliate program. Users can pledge aUTD to receive higher rewards and perks in return. aUTD will be pledged for a minimum of 3 months.\r\nRewards & Utility Program: The Program introduces an exclusive token \u201cmUTD\u201d (mini UTD), which aims to provide further utility to token holders. It will be used in the protocol's very own reward shop to redeem rewards such as NFTs and more. mUTD can be earned through either \u201cpledge\u201d or \u201cburn\u201d mechanisms.\r\nTreasury Management The protocol aims to take an active management strategy for the treasury funds to ensure its resources are effectively utilized. Initial management principles have been laid out to align with different growth phases of United DAO\u2019s treasury. Advisors and partners will provide access and expertise for such strategies, in what will ultimately be determined and finalized by the DAO.\r\n\r\nWho are the founder and advisors of United DAO? \r\nOur doxxed founder and his stellar team of advisors made up of top credible economics and finance professionals. They possess decades of relevant experience in various well-known MNCs, start-ups, and government entities.\r\nRead more about our founder and suite of stellar advisors in our whitepaper or website."}, "united-doge-finance": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19217/large/cropped-cropped-UDOG-Latest-Logo-2.png?1652862430", "rank": null, "colors": ["#006100", "#006D00"], "link": "https://www.uniteddogefinance.com/", "description": "# What is United Doge Finance (UDOG)?\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance is a community-driven token and platform that says its goal is to allow users to be able to build credit with the use of a crypto powered credit card, along with several other credit driven financial offerings.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to \"redistribute power from traditional banks and credit agencies to individuals\" - helping to create a more transparent, balanced and fair financial system.\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance was founded in August 2021 and created with the investor and community in mind. The goal is to provide generational wealth to all loyal holders with a hyper-deflationary functionality and automatic staking to reward UDOG holders.\r\n\r\nThe team behind the platform plans to develop its own ecosystem, including a crypto powered credit card, portfolio smart wallet, exchange/swap engine, cross-chain bridge, NFT marketplace, NFTs that will provide access to United Doge Finance in the metaverse and other financial offerings.\r\n\r\n**Who are the Founders of United Doge Finance?**\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance was founded by Brandon Collins and Keith Biggar Jr. Both co-founders have a background in business, leadership and entrepreneurship. They came together with a vision to simplify the banking and credit processes but also make it more transparent, balanced and fair for all.\r\n\r\nThe project is now headed by the co-founders, both of whom are transparently provided on the project\u2019s website.\r\n\r\n**What Makes United Doge Finance Unique?**\r\n\r\nIn contrast to many other crypto projects, United Doge Finance promises to provide a complete ecosystem that will provide its token actual value and real-world use cases. Their ecosystem will kick off with their proprietary decentralized cross-chain exchange/swap engine, which will feature an integrated cross-chain bridge. Its decentralized exchange is scheduled to launch in Q2 of 2022. The exchange will feature a rigorous KYP (Know Your Project) application process where developers of projects will have to provide identity and lock liquidity for a minimum of 2 years to be considered. The exchange will be hosted on udogswap.com.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will be followed by its portfolio smart wallet. The portfolio smart wallet will allow users to keep track of their investments, host credit accounts and stake their crypto holdings for a return. The portfolio smart wallet will also allow the users to store their NFTs and link to the exchange/swap engine, cross-chain bridge and NFT marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe UDOG token automatically distributes 3% of every buy and sell to its holders and automatically auto burns 2% of every buy and sell from its total supply, making the value of holdings increase with every transaction.\r\n\r\n**How Many United Doge Finance (UDOG) Tokens are there in Circulation?**\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance had a total supply of 100 quadrillion tokens at launch. 50% of that was burned at launch, allowing 50% to be available for circulation. In addition, United Doge Finance, being a deflationary token, auto burns 2% of every buy and sell. At the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of 98,819,674,411,864,700.\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance has an anti-whale feature that disallows a large token holder from trying to manipulate the price or dump the token, although it goes unclear whether this goes beyond mere price slippage when selling.\r\n\r\n**How is United Doge Finance Network Secured?**\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.\r\n\r\nERC-20 is a token standard most new tokens follow when publishing on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains and the go-to solution for many decentralized applications. Its proof-of-work consensus mechanism requires miners to mine new Ether and ensures that Ethereum is one of the safest blockchains in the crypto industry. A set of decentralized nodes validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\n**When Will United Doge Finance Trading Begin?**\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance trading began on August 10th, 2021, on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\n**Can United Doge Finance Hit $0.01?**\r\n\r\nRealistically speaking, given the 100 quadrillion initial supply, it is highly improbable United Doge Finance will ever reach $0.01, even accounting for the already burned supply. Ultimately, the likeliness of the token to hit its highest potential price, will be determined by how well the team can deliver on the project\u2019s vision and ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Where Can You Buy United Doge Finance (UDOG)?**\r\n\r\nUnited Doge Finance is available on Uniswap (V2) and SushiSwap."}, "united-emirate": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24977/large/zcbFg-Az_400x400.jpg?1649654476", "rank": null, "colors": ["#987434", "#DAA339"], "link": "https://unitedemiratecoin.net/"}, "united-traders-token": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1741/large/utt.png?1547036018", "rank": null, "colors": ["#EC3F3F", "#ED4040"], "link": "https://uttoken.io/", "description": "United Traders, found online at UnitedTraders.com, is a financial services company based in Moscow.
