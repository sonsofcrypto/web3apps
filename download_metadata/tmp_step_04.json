    "description": "0xcert is an open source, a permission-less protocol for certified non-fungible tokens on the blockchain. These tokens are stored in cryptographic wallets and are owned by users. In addition to common functions for managing and transferring standard non-fungible tokens, the 0xcert protocol provides conventions for creating certified non-fungible tokens from unique digital assets. These tokens are called Xcerts and are created through a custom minting process. Xcerts represent standard non-fungible tokens, which also hold information about a real-world digital asset. With 0xcert protocol, we can validate a proof of existence, authenticity, and ownership of these digital assets without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also uses fungible tokens known as ZXC as utility tokens in the system and comply with the ERC20 standard on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. The tokens are used to support decentralized applications that are built on top of the protocol. The role of the token is to be a mechanism used as an incentive and to support the entire ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe flexible nature of the 0xcert protocol infrastructure ensures that interoperability is achieved among decentralized applications. The protocol is flexible enough to support a variety of business models.The availability of the protocol's pluggable framework allows for the reduction of the time used during the building of decentralized applications.The protocol contains a registry of issuers that have been verified on the network, which allows for the authentication of issuers as well as knowing their validity. A common registry reduces the time taken for verification and reduces business risk.",

    "description": "\"What is 1inch Network?\r\n1inch Network is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator to help users discover the best trade prices for tokens. Instead of swapping tokens from a single liquidity pool of a DEX, 1inch will aggregate across different pools and suggest the most efficient way to trade tokens.\r\n\r\nWhy use 1inch?\r\nIf you are a trader trading large amount of tokens, you may not be aware of all the availability liquidity across different DEXes in order to get the best price quote. Price quote offered by DEX fluctuates according to the liquidity pool at any given time. Also, when you are trading large size, every percentage of savings can be magnified with an optimal trading path. 1inch aims to solve all that in a single user friendly interface.\r\n\r\nWhat is Pathfinder?\r\nPathfinder is the discovery and routing algorithm developed by the 1inch team. It is the algorithm the powers the backend to finding the most efficient route to swap a token. For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for WBTC, Pathfinder will explore all DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, DODO, Sushiswap, and more. The result is a recommended route that optimizes fees and liquidity in order to give users the best rate. Users no longer need to check each individual services in order to find the best price.\r\n\r\nWho are the creators of 1inch?\r\n1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov. The idea for 1inch was developed at a hackathon in just over 60 hours at New York City. Fast forward today, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi product.\"",

Going forward AAG is positioned to become the leading platform for Play-To-Earn (P2E) and Learn-To-Earn (L2E). AAG has a mission to create economic freedom worldwide through the metaverse and a goal to bring 100M people onto the metaverse by 2030.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe AAG strategy has 4 pillars:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Launch THE P2E platform. This platform will provide \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d for guilds and be the backbone for P2E. Features that will go into beta in 22Q1 include: wallet security, payroll automation and performance management.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Launch the world\u2019s first Learn-To-Earn (L2E) platform. L2E applications will pay participants crypto for learning transferable skills (e.g., math, programming or even how to build the Metaverse) through a gamified experience. Features from the P2E platform will accelerate this pillar.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) Expand the AAG Guild, which will allow us to generate immediate economic impact, expand across the globe (from 7 to 20 countries), diversify across games and gain first hand insight on how to build the first two pillars.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Stand up the AAG Nonprofit Foundation, which will allow us to execute initiatives that focus on creating economic freedom without concern for generating profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAAG\u2019s team represents 17 countries and is comprised of 15 full time and 45 total members. It includes boots-on-the-ground in SE Asia and LATAM, crypto natives and veterans of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The team includes 80+ years of combined software and operations experience (incl., Google, JPMorgan, TIBCO and McKinsey).\r\n\r\n\r\nAAG raised $12.5M in a private round led by Shima Capital, Tribe Capital and Tess Ventures.

    "description": "ABCC Digital Asset Exchange will issue ABCC Token (AT) on July 9th 2018 (UTC+8) as part of our User Incentive Plan.\r\n\r\n1. What is ABCC Token?\r\n\r\nABCC Token (AT) is an ERC20 Token to be issued by ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. The total supply of AT is fixed at 210 million without any future offering.\r\n\r\n2. Benefits of AT\r\n\r\nAT is a blockchain-based token native to ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. Members holding AT will be able to get access to a wide range of benefits including but not limited to\u2014\r\n\r\nUsing AT for various products and services on ABCC. For example, members can purchase other digital assets, pay transaction fees and gain preferential access to premium services with AT. \r\nParticipating in various activities and campaigns on ABCC. ABCC will reward members who meet certain criteria. For example, members holding AT will share in 80% of trading commissions collected by ABCC.\r\nParticipating in various activities such as community building, interaction between members and ABCC, proposing suggestions to ABCC and others. \r\n3. Initial Allocation\r\n\r\nBelow is a breakdown of the initial allocation of AT.\r\n\r\n4. Issuance\r\n\r\nWe will adopt a mechanism called \u201cTrade Contribution + Simultaneous Release\u201d to issue AT.\r\n\r\n4.1 Trade Contribution\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage our users to trade on ABCC, we have decided to reward our members with 50% of the total supply of AT. \r\n\r\nOf the 50% rewarded to users, 4/5 (i.e. 40% of the total supply) will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the \u201cTrade-to-Mine\u201d (ToM) mechanism. The other 1/5 (i.e. 10% of the total supply) will be granted to users who traded prior to the issuance of AT.\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Trade-to-Mine (ToM)\r\n\r\n40% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the \u201cTrade-to-Mine\u201d (ToM) mechanism.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspirations from the Bitcoin mining model, we have adopted a similar inflation model for AT.  In particular, the ToM mechanism includes two steps, i.e., \u201crelease\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d. \r\n\r\nRelease\r\n\r\nThe release of AT follows a half-life decay pattern. There are 6 half-life periods in total with each period being 120 days (roughly 4 months). We will release half of the total supply of AT in the first 120 days. The number of AT to be released in the following half-life period will be halved, and so on. Please see details of AT release schedule below. \r\n\r\nWithin each half-life period, one \u201cblock\u201d will be generated every 6 hours. The same number of AT will be released for every block inside the same half-life period. For example, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period is calculated as follows.\r\n\r\nThe total number of AT in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000;\r\nThe number of days in the 1st half-life period: 120 days;\r\nOne block will be generated every 6 hours;\r\nThe number of blocks to be generated every day: 24 hours / 6 hours = 4;\r\nTherefore, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000/120 / (24 hours / 6 hours) = 87,500.\r\nDistribution\r\n\r\nWe will distribute AT released in a block to members per the percentage of their trading fees within that block.\r\n\r\nIf it so happens that there are no members eligible for the rewards in a certain block, the released AT assigned to this block will be distributed in the next block.\r\n\r\n4.1.2 Reward for Historical Trades\r\n\r\n10% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward eligible existing users.  We will distribute the rewards to the eligible users based on their cumulative trade volume contribution ending 24:00 June 27th, 2018 (UTC+8). The rewards will be frozen for 180 days after the launch of AT.\r\n\r\n4.2 Simultaneous Release\r\n\r\nAT will be released to the platform, team and investors in proportion to the number of AT released and distributed to members via Trade-to-Mine (ToM).\r\n\r\nThe number of AT released via Simultaneous Release = the number of AT released and distributed via ToM * (50% / 40%).",

The first way is to issue real-life securities and tokenize them via various platforms by using the distributed network as a repository for all the transactions. Blockchain won\u2019t allow the info about securities to become misleading and will provide it with secure and high-speed operating.\r\n\r\nAs the industry goes forward with the broader acceptance of these assets and the technology that supports them, AST believes that more conversation between industry participants and regulators will aid in the expansion of security token markets and the adoption of the technology that supports them.",

    "description": "Achain is a public blockchain platform that enables developers of all levels to issue tokens and create smart contracts, decentralized applications, and blockchain systems. Achain is committed to building a global blockchain network for information exchange and value transactions. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, Achain utilizes a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">DPoS</a>\u200a\u2014\u200aRDPoS (Result-delegated Proof of Stake) to establish node consensus. Shortly, DPoS suggests that all coin holders vote for the validator nodes that will produce the next blocks.\r\n\r\nOn the project website, only info about CEO Tony Cui is listed. Cui has a few significant accomplishments, including winning the Future Star award from the Zhongguancun Alliance and being listed in the 30 under 30 on CYZONE, a famous venture capital magazine. On LinkedIn, 51 people are listed as employees at Achain. Most of the team is based in Beijing. Achain also has a few key industry partners. It has even co-organized a \u201cBlockchain Technology Open Course\u201d with Tsinghua University, which is widely recognized as one of the world\u2019s top universities.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for Achain development is fairly detailed. However, most goals listed are development-oriented rather than marketing or design. Still, it\u2019s important to note that focusing on making the protocol interoperable and building a technology that is more accessible to mainstream adoption could also be considered a marketing-oriented part of this project. There are three major phases with projected completion dates listed. These include Singularity (completed Q1), Galaxy (ongoing), and Cosmos (complete at the end of Q4). One thing to note is that dates for these phases are not consistent between the homepage and the whitepaper. This could be simply due to a scenario in which phase names remain the same while new goals and timeline dates within those phases continue to change. In January 2019, the project will update the website to reflect roadmap goals for the new year.\r\n\r\nLooking at the current landscape of blockchain projects, Achain certainly offers the possibility of much-needed technical innovations. The ability to easily create an Achain fork, as well as, the protocol\u2019s unique RDPoS consensus algorithm make this a promising project. It will be interesting to see how Achain builds upon its accomplishments, and how the project team continues to develop a long-term strategy for improving the protocol\u2019s technical capabilities and increasing participation in its ecosystem.",

Incorporating modern technologies such as cloud nodes and parallel processing, Aelf is the blockchain system that achieves secure transactions at commercial scale.\r\n\r\nAelf is one of the cryptocurrencies that is attracting crypto enthusiasts following its massive commercial adoption initiative. The coin seems to be leading on the technology front with higher blockchain efficiency, which is why it's also anticipated to be the Linux of Blockchains. aelf is an operating system for blockchains which can be customized by their respective users. Its cryptocurrency is denoted by the symbol ELF, with a total supply of 250 million ELF. It was launched on 21 December, 2017 on multiple exchanges in China without any ICO and instead got private investors on board. This ensured better compliance as KYC was done for all investors with most of them being accredited, with a good track record in token investment.\r\n\r\nAelf was developed by Ma Haobao, who is also the CEO of Hoopox. The team is backed by a strong advisory board which includes Michael Arrington (CEO of TechCrunch and founding partner of FGB Capital). The team says it is working on unleashing the blockchain\u2019s potential into mass applications and industries. aelf is now working with Innovation Alliance for increasing the acceptability of blockchain technology which will ultimately increase adoption of aelf\u2019s blockchain. The team is focussed to develop aelf to improve other chains in the ecosystem by providing a template and infrastructure for interaction between the sidechains.\r\n\r\nAelf also has a rewards system \u2013 Candy. With the Candy rewards system, you earn points, convertible for ELF, by accomplishing simple, daily tasks. Tasks include liking and replying to aelf tweets, inviting people to the Telegram channel, and other promotional activities. ELF are currently ERC20 tokens. As such, you can store them in any wallet with ERC20 support like MyEtherWallet or Exodus. The Ledger Nano S is also a great option if you\u2019re interested in additional security. \r\n\r\nAelf is a relatively new competitor in the dapp platform race but already has solid support from large investment capital firms.

    "description": "According to its whitepaper, Aeron aims to be the new standard of aviation safety powered by the blockchain. Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum. Additionally, as you would expect from a blockchain-backed application, key information is safely stored and is accessible to everyone with 100% transparency. Except that it now comes secured by a multi-sig authentication system that prevents any type of security breach. According to Aeron's Whitepaper, \"The pilot\u2019s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators\".\r\n\r\nAeron (ARN) is an ERC20 compliant <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> based token, with a fixed supply of 20,000,000 ARN. When the token was launched, a fixed amount of tokens were created and after which no more tokens are to be minted. About 60% of the supply is estimated to be in circulation. The supply should decrease over time when ARN tokens as taken out of circulation. Once Aeron receives ARN tokens in exchange of services, the coins will be again released in to the network.\r\n\r\nAccording to its whitepaper, Aeron plans to have a user base of 300000 by the end of 2020. This would encourage it to embed new features on its platform.\r\nWith the help of multi-app functionality and block technology, the company envisions to have an \u201cairline in the pocket\u201d of sorts within two years. While its price has fluctuated like most other cryptocurrencies, it delivered more than 15x returns within a short period between November 2017 to January 2018. As of July 2018, the price is nearly back to its November levels, at $0.57.",

Ten percent of all revenues from primary sales are donated to animal charities.\r\n\r\nHow Many AKTA Tokens are there in Circulation?\r\nAkita Inu launched on October 26, 2021 with 1 billion tokens created at genesis. Of these, 40% (400MM) were airdropped to the Algorand community; 35% (350MM) were used to provide liquidity on the Tinyman exchange; 20% (200MM) were retained for the Community Development Fund; and 5% (50MM) were reserved for the Founder\u2019s Wallet. According to the Akita Inu team, tokens in the Founder\u2019s Wallet will not be touched for at least twelve months after genesis.\r\n\r\nWho is Responsible for Akita Inu?\r\nAkita Inu is the brainchild of Founder & CEO Ryan Roberts, a project manager and veteran cryptocurrency investor who has been involved in the crypto space for over a decade. Before founding Akita Inu, he was also active as an NFT developer on the WAX, Ethereum and Algorand blockchains.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the Akita Inu project is driven by a transatlantic team whose skill sets include smart contract development, web development, marketing and graphic desig",

The project is based upon the idea that buying and selling transactions are taxed and the funds are then used to reward behaviours. \r\n\r\nWhen the token is bought from a liquidity pool the transactions are taxed 10%. This tax is given to the preexisting holders of the token pro rata to their share of the tokens when the sale was completed. Thus if a holder has 1% of the tokens, they will receive 1% of the tax taken for that transaction. Sell transactions are similarly taxed at 10% although the tax is used differently. Sell side taxes are sent to the projects treasury where a portion of the funds is added to the liqudity pool and locked for a significant amount of time and the remainder of the funds are used to invest on behalf of the token holders.\r\n\r\nThe returns from these investments are then split with 50% of all profits being returned to token holders pro rata to their holders and a portion of the profits goes to the team managing the portfolio with the remainder used to increase the amount used by the farm such that the farming becomes self sustaining. Over time, the holders will have a voice in the amount of taxes as well as their usage. The team has established industry veterans advising on the best way to invest such as to bring the best returns to token holders.",

    "description": "What Is AME Chain (AME)?\r\n\r\nAME Chain is the world\u2019s 1st Quantum secured Blockchain that is EVM compatible with high performance and scalability.\r\n\r\nAME Chain is an ambitious project dedicated to the establishment of an unconditionally secure blockchain that can withstand the threats arising out of Quantum computing. \r\n\r\nAME Chain is a platform that facilitates peer-to-peer communication, Smart contracts and applications via its own native currency called AME. The primary purpose of AME is to facilitate and monetize the working of AME Chain to enable developers to build and run distributed applications (called Dapps).\r\n\r\nAME Chain is a Turing complete blockchain framework, as it gives a foundation to programming languages using which you can write contracts that can solve any reasonable computational problem. AME Chain is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a consensus-based virtual machine that decodes the compiled contracts in bytecodes and executes them on the Ethereum network nodes. It also uses algorithms to prevent denial-of-service attacks that are widely observed in cryptocurrency markets.\r\n\r\nAME Chain network is a group of nodes, connected to every other node in a peer-to-peer mechanism. Each node consists of a copy of the entire blockchain data store and competes with other nodes to mine the next block by validating transactions. If a new block is added, the blockchain gets updated and is propagated to the entire network so that every node is in sync.\r\n\r\nAME Chain uses Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) as the consensus method that gives a small and designated number of blockchain actors the power to validate transactions or interactions with the network and to update its more or less distributed registry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of AME Chain?\r\n\r\nKamalakannan Venkatraman, Co-Founder and the important person behind AME Chain. His professional career started at American Express, where he shaped the career towards the Fintech Industry. Later on, he founded MoneyQ, a global financial consulting firm where he helped improve business strategies and increase revenue of over a 20 fintech firms. \r\n\r\nJaved Mohamed, Co-Founder of AME Chain and the Founder of AMEPOS, a successful tech software with over 2000 clients spread across India, Malaysia, Singapore, UAE and USA. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes AME Chain Unique?\r\n\r\nAME Chain is the world\u2019s first Quantum blockchain that uses quantum security to secure its cryptography - encryption, hashing and digital signatures. Whereas other blockchains use Pseudo random numbers (PRN) for these operations, AME Chain uses Quantum random numbers (QRN) generated from a laser based quantum source.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many AME Chain (AME) Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe AME Chain has announced that a total of 1.5 Billion AME will be released in circulation. At the moment, about 500 Million AME have already entered the market.\r\n\r\n1 Billion AME will be put into circulation after August 2023 and a massive AME burn event is planned on this supply.\r\n\r\nThe AME distribution is as follows: 4.8% will be towards Staking rewards, 6.4% of AME coins will be distributed among team members, 4% of AME will be distributed towards Development, 16% of AME is allotted for Community grants, 40% of AME is taken aside for Burn event and 28.8% is for the Company Reserves & Partnerships.\r\n\r\nAME price during the initial seed sale, held on September 2020, was $0.0075. Given the recent ATH, that represents an impressive 20X return on investment (ROI) \r\n\r\n\r\nHow Is the AME Chain Network Secured?\r\n\r\nAME Chain network is secured by multiple layers.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tQuantum security - Quantum Random Numbers are used in cryptographic operations\r\n\u2022\tCryptographic hashes to generate and validate blocks\r\n\u2022\tProof-of-Authority to form consensus between trusted nodes\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Buy AME Chain (AME)?\r\n\r\nAME coin can be purchased on few exchanges. One choice to trade AME is MEXC as it has the highest AME/USDT trading volume, $137,322,203 as of March 2022.\r\n\r\nNext is Gate.io, with a trading volume of $90,112,897. Other options to trade AME include Bit global, Bkex and XT.com. Of course, it is important to note that investing in cryptocurrency comes with a risk, just like any other investment opportunity.\r\n\r\nTo check AME price live in the fiat currency of your choice, you can use CoinMarketCap\u2019s converter feature directly on the https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/amepay/ .Popular AME price pairs include: AME/USDT, AME/ETH",

Using Amp, networks like Flexa can quickly and irreversibly secure transactions for a wide variety of asset-related use cases.\r\n\r\nHow does Amp work?\r\n\r\nAmp claims to offer a straightforward but versatile interface for verifiable collateralization through a system of collateral partitions and collateral managers. Where collateral partitions can be designated to collateralize any account, application, or even transaction, and carry balances which are directly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, collateral managers are smart contracts that can lock, release, and redirect collateral in these partitions as needed in order to support value transfer activities. Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address.",

The studio behind the project is Masayato Games, which is an indie game studio incorporated in Singapore with founders based in the Philippines. As of April 2022, the game is currently in closed beta, running on four platforms \u2013 PC, Mac, Android (via APK download), and iOS (via TestFlight). The game is expected to launch in June 2022.\r\n\r\nAnito Legends incorporates gameplay inspired by roguelike dungeon crawlers and auto-battler genres. It incorporates Filipino folklore as its main theme with English as its method of delivery. The two main game modes that will be included at launch are PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). To begin the game, players will need to purchase at least 3 Anito NFT units to fill out a party and begin adventuring. Anitos will be able to purchase weapons and other equipment to adjust to the different battle scenarios. Some of the end-game weapons and items can be minted as NFT\u2019s as well. \r\n\r\nThe game will make use of a two token system. $LARO is the governance token and will be used to purchase Anito NFT\u2019s after the pre-sale. $GINTO will be the utility token which will be used mainly for the in-game currency, sinks, cosmetic items. It will also be the token used for converting to fiat currency.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see https://anitolegends.com/ and https://docs.anitolegends.com/\r\n\"",

    "description": "AppCoins is a protocol for the App Economy created by the Aptoide App Store, and the first ICO serving 200 million users with the goal of creating a trustworthy economy without intermediaries. The AppCoins project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app. Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over 230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications. \r\n\r\nAppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their games or apps in the app store.The \u201cAppCoin\u201d ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating the return of the investment to the developers.\r\nMost industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.\r\n\r\nOnce the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to good returns for investors.\r\n\r\nAppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident that the returns of the AppCoins\u2019 solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them. However, it should be noted that it does not form a good investment option for a short period of time.",

    "description": "Aragon is a decentralized app (dApp) on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain that allows anyone to create and manage a decentralized organization. The Aragon project is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that\u2019s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an organization on the blockchain. \r\n\r\nIn the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve, scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors. It also doesn\u2019t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don\u2019t get it twisted, the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a \u201cBest Underage European Programmer\u201d award, and he\u2019s a recipient of Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 recognition. He\u2019s a young guy, but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\r\n\r\nAragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company or organization requires. It\u2019s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned on and off, providing instant customization for the company\u2019s needs. In addition, all of the code behind Aragon is open source. A company\u2019s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company\u2019s requirements. \r\n\r\nThe modular design of Aragon doesn\u2019t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies can edit existing modules, they\u2019re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon, combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction. Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn\u2019t operate based on country boundaries. Instead, it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.\r\n\r\nThe ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive structure of the platform. It represents the wealth of the decentralized economy and was initially sold during Aragon\u2019s highly successful ICO in May 2017 that raised $24 million. Subsequently, the ANT token has come to represent a powerful share of the governance on the platform. ANT holders can vote on proposals, participate in arbitration and the decentralized court system, and help contribute to the non-profit Aragon Foundation or to research and development through the Aragon Nest program.",

    "description": "Ardor is the latest in the growing field of contenders for blockchain as a service (BaaS) providers. Ardor provides the blockchain infrastructure for businesses and institutions to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology without having to invest in developing custom blockchain solutions. Instead, Ardor offers a main chain that handles blockchain security and decentralization plus customizable child chains that come ready to use, right out of the box, for various business applications. Ardor goes beyond Nxt to solve critical issues of blockchain bloat, scalability, and customization.\r\n\r\nNxt is a well respected, verified, and established blockchain technology with a comparatively long history and an experienced development team. However, as blockchain usage increases over the coming years Nxt, and other blockchain technologies, will face some fundamental problems with payments, scalability, and customization. The first and most straightforward problem is the use of native tokens for transaction fees. Nxt uses a forging proof of stake system, meaning that the total token supply has already been created and new tokens aren\u2019t created with each block. Instead, the forgers that verify the blocks receive a portion of the transaction fees paid on the network. As such, the transaction fees need to be paid in NXT, even if you\u2019ve created a new currency that\u2019s independent of Nxt, you\u2019ll still need to own NXT in order to pay miners, diluting the value of your own currency. \r\n\r\nTo test Ardor\u2019s capabilities and serve as an example of an operating child chain, the Ardor developers have created Ignis. Ignis will implement all of the customizable features that come from the Nxt code base. Essentially, Ignis will be a proof of concept and could be the first of many more child chains on the Ardor platform. The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ignis\">Ignis</a> ICO recently raised $15 million in funding for development. In the future, Ardor child chains could be used to create equity trading platforms, digital file transfer services, private enterprise blockchain applications, and many more use cases. Ardor\u2019s strengths are quick time to setup and wide customizability, making it a great option for companies looking to leverage blockchain without the resources to dedicate to custom development.\r\n\r\nArdor has many architectural advantages. One of them and perhaps the most influential one is that it has been created using Java; one of the most widespread programming languages in the world today. This is definitely a step in the right direction seeing as it becomes ten times easier for a commercial application to succeed if the development language is one which most programmers can relate to.",

They aim to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a virtual spiderweb of endless use-cases that make ARK highly flexible, adaptable, and scalable. ARK is a secure platform designed for mass adoption and will deliver the services that consumers want and developers need. It is fast, decentralized, scalable, collaborative, bridging and open-source. The ARK Desktop Wallet is natively built for all major Operating Systems. ARK wallets connect to fully synced network peers removing the need to download the full blockchain.\r\n\r\nARK operates using a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated+Proof-of-Stake&view=market\">Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</a> consensus algorithm. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, in which miners with expensive rigs secure network transactions, the ARK network is secured by delegates. There are hundreds of potential delegates, but token holders in the ARK ecosystem continuously vote on who actually gets to be an active, forging delegate. Only 51 delegates make the cut. As a token holder, you\u2019re only allowed to vote for one delegate at a time. The fee to vote/unvote is just 1 ARK, so it\u2019s advantageous to at least vote once for a delegate you support. The more ARK tokens you own, the more powerful your vote.\r\n\r\nARK was launched in February of this year by 27 members spread across the world. With team members located everywhere from California to Bulgaria \u2013 the ARK Crew is truly decentralized. The team currently consists of 15 core members. The ARK infrastructure is modeled heavily on that of three older projects: <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitshares\">Bitshares</a>, Crypti, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lisk\">Lisk</a>. In fact, some of the ARK developers were previously developers on some of those projects. Francois-Xavier (FX) Thoorens, the CTO, was a core developer at Lisk in 2016.\r\n\r\nArk Community\r\nA diverse group of people and skill sets, including Full Stack and Web Developers, Network Engineers, Hardware Experts, Money Managers, Musicians, Traders, Social Media Promoters, and Business Owners, uniting to realize a vision shared by 30 members of the ARK Crew. All passionately devoted to collaboration and the development of the ARK ecosystem and community.\r\n\r\nArk Token\r\nSecured by a cryptographic blockchain network similar to Lisk and Crypti, running on a Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus Algorithm developed by Bitshares. ARK DPoS provides a newly adapted voting system and incorporates many improvements over previous DPoS implementations.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://blog.ark.io/what-is-the-ark-smartbridge-and-how-does-it-work-1dd7fb1e17a0\">SmartBridge</a>\r\nTo increase the reach of the ARK platform, ARK bridges together useful and proprietary blockchains through the use of ARK SmartBridges. These SmartBridges allow for communication among validated bridged blockchains with the ability to perform tasks and advanced functions. Through the use of SmartBridges, the ARK Crew is able to connect many popular blockchains and finally create a unifying bond among different ecosystems. As examples, the first blockchains the ARK Crew will bridge are: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, 3rd Party Anonymous Network Integration, one or more proprietary gaming economy tokens (Codename: A***** [Ticker: A***]), and numerous other bridges connecting new and already existing blockchains in the future. \r\n\r\nSecurity\r\nBecause we understand security is a major point of concern for everyone, cryptographic and security principals are incorporated throughout the entire Development Life Cycle to guarantee a secure core meeting the requirements and expectations of our users. Through continuous risk analysis and internal recurring penetration testing, we provide a system that fulfills the high standards required by this type of environment. \r\n\r\nPrivacy\r\nARK Anonymous Network Integration provides ARK users with optional privacy when sending ARK transactions throughout all of the services developed for the ARK platform. Anonymization services could be potentially provided by a 3rd Party technology integration Partnership.\r\n\r\nSelf-Sustaining\r\nThe ARK Crew has a mission to make blockchain technology easily accessible to consumers\u200b, even to the point where consumers do not know that they are using it. We not only develop the tools bridging the virtual with reality, but also provide the unique services consumers want, understand, and are willing to purchase using ARK. The ARK Crew develops additional platforms and services benefiting from the ARK technology, providing online and offline revenue streams for the ARK Platform, and leading to faster research and development of new and exciting ways to encourage consumer participation, educating them about blockchain technology, while simultaneously adding value to the ARK coin. By incorporating revenue streams into our projects, the ARK Crew can provide even more unique services for user adoption as we grow.",

    "description": "Artery Network is a project launched on its own blockchain (Artery Blockchain) on October 18, 2020. Its main task is to provide the market with tools to improve the data safety on the Internet.  So, for example, at the project start a mobile application with the same name was released with Artery Storage and Artery VPN products.Their work is ensured by members of the Artery Network, who allocate resources such as disk space and Internet connection in the same application, in the Artery Node product.  Network participants who provide the resources of their devices receive a reward in ARTR project coins depending on the amount of allocated resources.  There exists also the Artery Network computer application, which was originally intended for block validation. Finally, from early 2021 the team of developers began to implement the Artery Storage and Artery VPN products, as well as the ability to allocate the resources of personal computers to increase the volume of decentralized storage and the bandwidth of Artery VPN.  As of June 2021, products for computer application have successfully passed testing and are ready for release.  The ultimate goal of the products is, in addition to providing them to private users, also adapting them for B2B sector. This will result in B2B sector using all the resources of the network, thus providing network members with constant rewards.\r\n\r\nThe total issue of coins is 4.000.000.000 ARTR. The issue term is approximately 10 years. Coins are mined by means of delegating them. Delegation helps to ensure the coin with liquidity, as well as to support other network participants in becoming validators, thus strengthening the Artery Blockchain.  So, for example, as of June 2021, 93% of ARTRs are in delegation.  This shows that almost all coins are frozen and not traded on the stock exchange, thus strengthening the coin's rate.  Depending on the number of frozen (delegated) coins, a reward is paid to the user, in that way new coins appear on the market.  Delegation fees are listed in the WhitePaper of the project.  In order to avoid inflation, periods of decreasing remuneration to delegators were undertaken, the first of which took place on April 18, 2021.  During the first 7 months of the project, the ARTR rate increased 14 times from $ 0.11 to $ 1.4 (as of June 5, 2021).\r\n\r\nThe key objective of the project is to win the leading position in providing decentralized solutions for both individual users and B2B market.",

    "description": "What is Aspire (ASP)? \r\nAspire is a decentralized asset solution platform that allows users to create their own digital assets and tokens without the need of developer help. The first asset created on Aspire is named ASP. ASP is the native utility asset used on Aspire to create new assets and tokens. At the time of writing, 10 ASP is charged as the fee to create a custom named asset or token. This creation fee may be lowered or raised if necessary, in order to keep asset creation inexpensive for Aspire users. In the future ASP will be used as the fuel for smart contracts. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all transactions on Aspire require a small amount of gas known as GASP.  Aspire's platform runs on the proof-of-work \u201cgAsp\u201d blockchain where all transactions and assets are recorded. Aspire\u2019s gAsp blockchain utilizes advanced checkpoints. This advanced security feature protects all Aspire assets and tokens from 51% mining attacks and double spending.\r\nAspire\u2019s open-source project was built from redesigned legacy Counterparty software. By replacing the Bitcoin blockchain with the gAsp blockchain, Aspire can perform transaction fees to the amount of .00000001 Gatoshi per byte.  This results in over 300k Aspire transactions per GASP. The gAsp blockchain also has 4MB sized blocks to allow for more transactions while supporting a block time average of 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nAspire tools include: \r\nAspire Wallet https://www.aspirewallet.com/ used to create, send, receive, hold and view Aspire assets and tokens. Aspire Wallet is also used to create sub assets and sub tokens, change an assets description or quantity, lock assets and tokens. Additionally, Aspire Wallet offers the ability to easily distribute assets and tokens to holders of other assets/tokens.\r\nAspire Explorer https://www.aspireexplorer.com/ aids in tracking transactions performed on Aspire \r\nAspire API https://aspirecrypto.com/aspire-api/ Information on Aspire API \r\nAspire Fednode https://aspirecrypto.com/exchange-integration/ Simple deployment on local environments.\r\nAspire Command Line Tools for developer application integration.\r\nAspire Github https://github.com/AspireOrg/ Fully open source software.\r\nMore features will be added to Aspire Wallet in 2021. \r\n\r\nHow Many ASP Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\nAspire launched its mainnet on July 4th, 2020 with 1 billion ASP tokens created at genesis. No additional ASP will ever be created. ASP is fully premined and Aspire Technology Inc sells tokens to exchanges as they are needed by community demand.\r\n45% equal to 450 million ASP was allocated to Aspire Technology Inc, these ASP are locked.\r\n25% equal to 250 million ASP was offered by a Bermuda crowdsale (Non-USA Residents)\r\n26% of the private sale sold authorizing 61,483,651 ASP into circulation. \r\n21% of the unsold ASP from the crowdsale were airdropped to bCommerce labs authorizing 52,000,000 ASP into circulation. \r\nThe remaining 53% equal to 136,516,349 of unsold ASP private sale are locked up.\r\n20% equal to 200 million ASP was allocated to founding members, these ASP are locked.\r\n10% equal to 100 million ASP was allocated to external development, these ASP are locked.\r\nAll coins not sold or allocated from the crowdsale are unlocked at 12.5 percent quarterly beginning December 30, 2020.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Aspire?\r\nThe Aspire project officially began April 10th, 2017 and was founded by CEO Jim Blasko of Las Vegas Nevada and Michael Terpin of San Juan Puerto Rico. The Aspire platform mainnet was launched on July 4th, 2020. \r\n\r\nJim Blasko is a blockchain developer and crypto pioneer known for mining Bitcoin in late 2010, and developing early altcoins such as UnbreakableCoin, Voxels, eBoost, and X-Coin. Jim is the founder of Bitcoin Talk Radio, and Cryptos.io. He has taken roles on other teams including Lunch Money, Talent Joe, FLASH, NetCoin, PIVX, Jewelz, Guardium, Neutron, and Minex. In 2013 Jim teamed up with Michael Terpin to launch bCommerce Labs, a blockchain incubator. Jim is actively found at Bitcoin conventions as a speaker and is now leading Aspire.\r\n\r\nMichael Terpin is founder and CEO of Transform Group , whose divisions include Transform PR, a global public relations firm that has served more than 200 clients in the blockchain field and helped launch more than 100 ICO\u2019s, including Aeternity, Augur, Dent, Ethereum, Factom, Golem, MaidSafe, and Neo; Michael is also the founder of CoinAgenda, a global event series for cryptocurrency investors and blockchain innovators since 2014 and Transform Strategies, the company\u2019s advisory division.\r\n\r\nHow is the Aspire Network Secured?\r\nAspire and the assets/tokens created on Aspire are secured via proof-of-work mining on the gAsp blockchain. The gAsp blockchain is protected by checkpointing every block preventing 51% attacks and double spending on the Aspire platform.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Aspire Unique?\r\nAspire improves on speed, cost, and security for creating both fungible and non-fungible digital assets and tokens. \r\n\r\nEasy to use - Aspire allows anyone to create assets/tokens in under two minutes.\r\n\r\nSpeed \u2013 Instant transactions and two-minute confirmations make Aspire 5 times faster than Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nCost Efficient - 1 GASP allows more than 300,000 transactions of any Aspire asset/token created on the Aspire platform making it the most cost-effective platform in the world.\r\n\r\nSecurity \u2013 The first asset creation platform running on a proof-of-work blockchain secured with advanced checkpointing.\"",

ATB Coin's users can achieve better decentralization, transparency, privacy, and cost-efficiency in their financials. Low energy consumption, ease of use, and better network participation incentives work in line with doubled network capacity, smart contracts, lightweight wallet, and cloud mining to provide people from all over the world a worthwhile, stable, and more reliable way of handling their financial needs.\r\n\r\nThe strongest advantages of ATB Coin are the new blockchain technologies, such as SegWit and Lightning Network. Now these protocols are only laid in existing cryptocurrencies, but in ATB Coin they will be basic, since partial implementation of the above-described blockchain upgrades will be implemented already from the start.\r\nThis gives ATB Coin a number of useful features, one of them is an unlimited number of transactions processed absolutely free of charge in the so-called payment channel. The Lightning Network protocol also allows you to calculate the network commission only when the channel is closed (for example, at the end of the day or month). This fundamental feature is difficult to overestimate, as it increases the efficiency of bandwidth blockchain.\r\nAnother available advanced feature is ATB-Code, which is the ability to cold store and transfer coins via code. This is a more advanced analogue of the BTC-E codes implemented on the blockchain. In summary, everything that ATB Coin has from the beginning will provide a wide field for application in Smart Contracts, which is already used in different spheres of business and everyday life.\"",

Unlike many other tokens in the DeFi ecosystem, USV is backed by the Atlas treasury, giving it an intrinsic, rising value also known as \"\"the book value\"\". Atlas USV's Treasury is made of 5 components: Stables, USV Liquidity, Passive Growth Tokens, Partner Tokens, and Other Atlas Layers.\r\n\r\n(1) Stables such as DAI and Frax are required to mint USV.\r\n(2) USV Liquidity Pool Tokens are offered through barter contracts and owned by the treasury.\r\n(3) The Passive Growth portfolio of tokens is managed by an engine that optimizes the portfolio's formula using a modified version of Markowitz's Optimal Portfolio Theory (Harry Markowitz, \"\"Portfolio Selection\"\" The Journal of Finance, 1952). This feature is coming soon.\r\n(4) Atlas USV is built to be the default backbone currency for DeFi. As such, Atlas expects major partnerships with other protocols that will benefit the treasury.\r\n(5) The Atlas Project will continue to release more layers with additional, distinct utilities and tokens that build on Atlas USV. The treasury will accumulate these tokens and capture value from these additional layers.",

That\u2019s why we issued our own token, which will be used also as tradable asset.\r\n\r\nur token is called AWC (Atomic Wallet Coin). A strict limit of 100 000 000 AWC will be created, never to be increased. AWC will run natively on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC20 and issued to regulate Atomic Wallet service prices in a decentralized and egalitarian manner. Atomic Wallet Coin is a universal method of payment for cryptocurrency listing in Atomic Wallet, Currency promotion or Swap Order interface placement.\r\n\r\nAWC token will be used to pay for different fees on Atomic Wallet platform, including but not limited to:\r\n1. Listing new assets in Atomic Wallet - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase integration within the Atomic Wallet for the AWC-tokens. The price of integration will be 100,000 AWC-tokens. It will be a great possibility for the new coins and tokens to become a part of Atomic Wallet ecosystem\r\n\r\n2.Listing new assets in Atomic swap exchange - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase integration within the Atomic Wallet swap exchange market for the AWC-tokens. The price of integration will be 150,000 AWC-tokens.\r\n\r\n3.Highlights and featurings in Atomic Wallet interfaces  - Each cryptocurrency, foundation or token will be able to purchase promotion within the Atomic Wallet GUI for the AWC-tokens. The price of integration will be determined in each particular case AWC-tokens, and we are developing a lot of advertising possibilities for this goals.\r\n\r\n4. Atomic swap usage - For the swaps exceeding 1 BTC since the end of 3Q 2018 users will be obliged to have at least 0.5 AWC token on the same Ethereum address with the one used by the Atomic Wallet. This option will be helpful for users with big amount of transactions.\r\n\r\n5.Increasing atomic swap rating - Each customer will receive a public rating which will influence his/her position in Atomic Wallet Orderbook GUI. The rating will be determined on the basis of successfully completed swaps and the volume of trades. To boost his/her experience customer will be able to increase rating by paying in AWC-tokens. The rating mechanics will be announced in 3Q 2018.",

One of the examples is dynamic interest rates.\r\n\u2013 It enables NFTs to be used in DeFi in various use cases, including using NFTs as collateral.\r\n\r\nAugmented Finance is engineered in a smart way to boost adoption:\r\n\u2013 High yields (APY) on major assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, ETH) with accelerated yield farming.\r\n\u2013 4x yield boost with automatic maximization for supply, borrow, stake via locking AGF token as per the mechanism proposed by Andre Cronje (similar to Curve\u2019s mechanic of locking CRV for veCRV).\r\n\u2013 Robust tokenomics with powerful governance token. Backed by 200 agent-based simulations. AGF token has high utility and is used for various purposes: stake, boost yields on supplied/borrowed assets, get a share of treasury funds, and vote on DAO proposals and protocol parameters.\r\n\u2013 Fair launch: no pre-mine, no ICO. Almost all AGF tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers to incentivize protocol adoption and decentralize the governance.\r\n\u2013 High security.

    "description": "Auroracoin is a decentralised, peer-to-peer, and secure cryptocurrency released as an alternative to the Icelandic Kr\u00f3na to bypass governmental restrictions associated with the national fiat currency. It was launched with the aim of becoming the \u2018official\u2019 cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar \u00d3\u00f0insson. It was originally based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\">DigiByte</a>.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network\u2019s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Gr\u00f8stl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">BTC</a> blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.",

This allows investors to continually increase the total number of tokens in their investment. The investment can grow in value even if the average price of the tokens doesn't change, because the number of tokens in the investment keeps growing.\r\n\r\nThe tokens have been designed to separate the gambling and investing aspects of cryptocurrency trading. The changes in the relative prices are predictable, and so the opportunity to profit doesn't depend on speculation. Investors who trade tokens for more tokens don't risk a loss, measured in tokens, and they don't inflict a loss on other traders.",

These coins will be kept in staking pools or in a separate area, or even in a separate DeFi protocol. They will be used to support the price of AVFI in case it drops too low.

As the blockchain network of choice for most businesses, its maximum transaction throughput is wildly insufficient in meeting demand. The economics of supply and demand have thus skyrocketed transaction fees making them prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nThe Aventus Network (AvN) solves that problem by letting businesses build on top of the Ethereum network with Aventus\u2019 second-layer protocol. With the AvN, applications can easily work with any other promising blockchain tech, cross-chain, by plugging into the Polkadot ecosystem, building on Substrate.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Aventus\r\n\r\nScale\r\nThe Aventus Network (AvN) can theoretically scale to 2,000 transactions per second. This is 133 times more than Ethereum.\r\n\r\nPrice\r\nThe average transaction cost on the Aventus Network will begin at just $0.01 (paid in AVT) and decrease over time. This is 99% cheaper than the average Ethereum transaction fee over the past year. \r\n\r\nSpeed\r\nThe AvN will process a token transfer within 0.13 seconds. This is 100 times faster than the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Grade \r\nThe AvN will onboard a minimum of 8.5 million client transactions that have been active in private test networks throughout the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Use Cases: Financial Assets, Supply Chains, Rewards and Loyalty, Live Entertainment, Data Integrity, Decentralised Applications\r\n",

    "description": "What Is Bancor (BNT)?\r\n\r\nBancor is the only decentralized staking protocol that allows you to earn money with single-token exposure and full protection from impermanent loss. Launched in 2017, Bancor was the first DeFi protocol.\r\nToday, it generates millions in fees per month for depositors, offering up to 60% APR on tokens like ETH, WBTC, LINK, MATIC, AAVE & more. Bancor is owned by its community as a decentralized autonomous organization (Bancor DAO).\r\nThe protocol token used on the network is the \u201cBancor Network Token,\u201d BNT. The protocol\u2019s token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Anyone can contribute liquidity to the pools. When liquidity providers contribute liquidity to a pool, they are eligible to receive fees for trades that pass through the pool. Liquidity providers will receive pool tokens that represent their share of liquidity, fees, and Liquidity Mining rewards in the pool.\r\n\r\nHow Many Bancor (BNT) Coins Are In Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe Bancor Network Token (BNT) has an elastic supply, afforded by the protocol's minting and burning of tokens to maintain trading liquidity levels in Bancor pools. Protocol-owned trading liquidity earns swap fees from trading volume, such that the protocol comes to hold more BNT over time. The protocol's new balance of BNT is then burned in exchange for pool tokens when LPs stake the equivalent amount of their own BNT. Due to swap fees earned, more BNT is ultimately burned than was initially supplied by the protocol. This excess of BNT is then burned to offset the cost of impermanent loss, deflating the overall supply of BNT in the long term.\r\n\r\nHow Is The Bancor Network Secured?\r\n\r\nBancor is one of the longest-running and most heavily audited projects in crypto, receiving stellar ratings from leading auditors including Certik, PeckShield, and Halborn. In addition, Bancor received one of the highest safety scores to date by DeFiSafety (96%) in 2021.\r\n\r\nOur most recent articles about Bancor:\r\n\r\nImpermanent Loss: What Is It and How Can I Reduce Its Impact?\r\nCrypto Outperforms Traditional Markets With DEX Tokens Leading the Way: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock\r\n",

    "description": "Basic Attention Token (BAT) is an open-source, decentralized ad exchange platform built on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> platform. Basic Attention Token held an initial coin offering on May 31, 2017 for its eponymous ERC-20 utility token, raising approximately $35M USD at the time in less than 30 seconds. The Basic Attention Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque. \r\n\r\nBasic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data. Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates into rewards for publishers.\r\n\r\nA user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements, is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.\r\n\r\nCreated back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla. Other noteworthy team members include Brian Bondy, lead developer and co-founder of Brave and Scott Locklin, senior engineer, and co-founder of Kerf Software.\"\r\n\r\nBasic Attention Token is created by the team that built the <a href=\"https://brave.com/coi600\">Brave browser</a>, an open-source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers. The browser measures user attention and rewards publishers for users attention. \r\n\r\nUse the Brave browser to protect your privacy and support CoinGecko at the same time: https://brave.com/coi600",

    "description": "BDECO is a decentralized and public blockchain. Its consensus method is Proof of Stake (PoS), with validators called Masternodes (MN). The blocks are extracted by the stakers every minute, this guarantees a fast \"timeframe\" for the execution of transactions and the writing of information. Each block can contain less of 1MB of information. The capacity of each individual transaction to contain arbitrary data (through OP_RETURN) is 10 kilobytes.\r\n\r\nThe BDECO ecosystem is based on five fundamental pillars thanks to which more or less complex decentralized applications can be developed, which interact at various levels with the Blockchain:\r\n\r\nBDCashCore: is the main javascript library. It allows the creation and management of .sid files, the signature of transactions and data, and the basic interfacing with NODESH.\r\n\r\nNODESH: is the NodeJS library needed to develop the blockchain interface nodes, these nodes perform various functions including: block explorer, UTXO tracking and file storage on the IPFS (Interplanetary File System) system.\r\n\r\nIDBDCASH: is the NodeJS library that manages the interaction between external digital identities and the addresses of the BDCashProtocol blockchain. Thanks to the framework it is possible to identify and \"mark\" bdcash addresses using various external providers.\r\n\r\nTrustlink BDECO: integrated within the NODESH, the Trustlink is a mechanism thanks to which it is possible to create wallets called \"multisignatures\" which provide for the obligation of the presence of multiple signatures to perform transactions and therefore data writing.\r\n\r\nChains Platform: it is the solution to help tokenization processes: an open and permissionless sidechain system that allows you to create, exchange and track your own digital assets (tokenized assets) only through the bdcash blockchain.\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts BDECO: is the scripting system that allows you to create application details, directly incorporated into the NODESH.\r\n\r\nRead DOC: https://docs.bdcashprotocol.com",

Using them like threads of yarn, the dreamers among us can weave together inventions we would have not thought to conceive.\r\n\r\nFrom the smart phone -- a camera, a touch screen, GPS, an internet connection -- applications were built which revolutionized entire industries (e.g. Uber and Instagram). From Beyond Protocol, mega applications can be engineered on top of any combination of IoT devices: from smart pills to satellites. Imagine a Nest smoke alarm paying a drone to put out a fire, and the drone making micropayments to weather towers along the way to determine the best route. Beyond Protocol sets out to be the ethical language of machines.\r\n\r\nAfter over a year of R&D, in early 2019, the Beyond Protocol team put forth the first iterations of its novel technology to a handful of partners. The technology allows its partners, with one line of code, to 1. enable secure message brokering between devices through hardware signatures 2. equip devices with a cryptocurrency and fiat based payment gateway.\r\n\r\nBeyond seeks to build real, practical solutions for device security and payments from consumers to devices, and soon, among an economy of devices.

The name \"Binance\" is a combination of binary and finance.\r\n\r\nThus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\r\n\r\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?asset_platform_id=279\">ERC20 token standard</a> from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.\r\n\r\nOther tokens that are issued by exchanges include <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox Token</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb\">OKB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/huobi-token\">Huobi Token</a>, and more.",

Founded by its CEO, Christoph Elbert in 2017, the bitcci Group AG is building an entirely new global ecosystem for the next-generation sex industry, eliminating problems and making the industry legal, safe and free. In July 2021 the bitcci AG, the daughter company of the bitcci Group AG started an ICO and raised about 7.5 Mio USD winning over 5000 Token holders. bitcci moved to a new and larger office in the Cryptovalley area of Zug / Switzerland in December 2021. The bitcci Group has started a Series A financing round and a marketing campaign in June 2022 for 10 Mio CHF to win larger scale investors and speed up the growth of the bitcci ecosystem. In Q4/2022 the bitcci Group plans to start a Security Token offering with a tokenized share, the \u201cbitcci Equity Token\u201d, to raise an additional 200 Mio. CHF. We are already in the process of preparing the approvals from the financial regulation authorities to start the public sale. bitcci optimizes, regulates and decentralizes the entire sex industry, develop new business areas, introduce innovative technologies. We establish a new, modern culture of acceptance, transparency, trust and free self-determination. Within the \"bitcci ecosystem,\" we are building a new, global network of our own nightclubs, portals, apps, cloud services, and blockchain-based payment solutions for the next generation sex Industry. The global sex market was worth over $ 200 billion in 2021. The potential for growth is huge, because the internet has significantly changed the way in which sex is perceived and how it is experienced. For example, since 1980, the number of men who purchase sexual services has doubled worldwide. In addition to the great potential for the industry, there are also many challenges in the industry for which bitcci is developing unique solutions. Along the value chain of sexual services, we offer sex workers a modern package of services and training programmes marked by free self-determination that ensure their stable and long-term loyalty to the bitcci ecosystem and a high work-life balance. The fact that our IT system is already in operation in the 5 large nightclubs in Switzerland gives us the necessary business data and know-how regarding their needs. The operation of these 5 nightclubs has shown us that there is a considerable need for optimization, modernization, standardization and regulation in the industry. Our entire strategy and culture within the bitcci ecosystem is geared towards achieving these goals. The bitcci Group is preparing the launch of a new portal \u201cbitcci.com\u201d in Q3/2022, which contains all state of the art functions and possibilities for sex workers to promote themselves and monetize their content and communication.",

It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. Bitcoin uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=SHA-256\">SHA-256</a> hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\r\n\r\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/primecoin\">Primecoin</a>, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> which led to the development of other amazing projects such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a>, and even crypto-collectibles such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ethereum-still-king-dapps-cryptokitties-need-1-billion-on-eos\">CryptoKitties</a>.",

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\">Bitcoin Core software</a>. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core\u2019s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\">Bitcoin SV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\">Bitcoin ABC</a>",

    "description": "What Is Bitcoin SV (BSV)? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBitcoin SV (BSV) emerged following a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain in 2018, which had in turn forked from the BTC blockchain a year earlier. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfil the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper, early Bitcoin client software and known Satoshi writings. BSV aims to offer scalability and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe BSV network is unique in its capacity for unbounded on-chain scaling while also being more aligned with the original design of Bitcoin than any other blockchain. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWho are the founders of Bitcoin SV (BSV)? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBlockchain technology company nChain developed the BSV node software and has regularly delivered protocol updates that restore the functionality of the original Bitcoin protocol.  nChain now provides the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team which continues to advance the node software and other infrastruture tools for the BSV network. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nnChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, has been a supporter of BSV since the split between BCH and BSV in 2018, following the proposal of controversial protocol changes by several BCH developers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEntrepreneur Calvin Ayre is also a vocal advocate for BSV and regularly seeks investment opportunities in companies and projects building on the blockchain. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter BSV split from BCH, a Switzerland-based non-profit industry association known as Bitcoin Association was formed that now supports the global growth and adoption of the BSV blockchain and digital currency.  Work of the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team at nChain is performed at the request and direction of Bitcoin Association. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat makes Bitcoin SV (BSV) unique? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBSV differs from other versions of Bitcoin in its adherence to the original Bitcoin protocol and focus on realising the vision for the Bitcoin network outlined in the Bitcoin white paper and other known Satoshi Nakamoto writings. Unlike BTC, which now primarily functions as an investment or store of value asset, BSV aims to offer a scalable and usable blockchain platform for efficient payments and distributed data applications for consumer, enterprise and government users. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks to its unbounded block size, BSV can scale to meet market forces and accommodate the demands of any application and payment network without resorting to second-layer solutions.   In 2021, the BSV network mined the world\u2019s first gigabyte (1000+ megabytes) level blocks \u2013 reaching up to 2 GBs in August 2021; for comparison, 2 GBs is 2000 times the 1MB block cap of the BTC network.  Block capacity of the BSV network is expected to continue growing further to support more transaction volume and data use caes. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith testing of the new node software, the BSV Infrastructure Team has already demonstrated the BSV network\u2019s ability to handle up to 100,000 transactions per second and expects that capacity to be shown on the BSV mainnet and grow even higher in the future. With this capability, BSV rivals and aims to supersede the payment processing capabilities of platforms like VISA at a fraction of the cost to users. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBSV also offers a scalable and product-ready platform for blockchain application developers, many of whom have migrated from other networks such as Ethereum after encountering scaling issues as their adoption increased. BSV is capable of scaling along with user adoption, which means developers can be assured that transaction fees will remain low and interactions will be processed quickly. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe functionality of BSV is attractive to enterprise and government users, with the blockchain offering an efficient and stable platform for companies and agencies looking to experiment or build with blockchain technology.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow many Bitcoin SV (BSV) coins are there in circulation? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs defined by the original Bitcoin protocol, there will be a maximum of 21 million BSV coins in circulation. Fresh coins from this circulation are distributed to BSV miners via block rewards, which they earn in addition to transaction fees for validating blocks. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBlock rewards for miners are cut by 50% at predefined periods to slowly shift the reliance of miners on these subsidies to transaction fees and to reduce the flow of new tokens as they approach their maximum quantity. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow Is the Bitcoin SV network secured? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBSV is secured by the proof-of-work consensus mechanism as described in the Bitcoin white paper. This means that for a block containing new transactions to be added to the blockchain, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem using their computer\u2019s processing power. The miner who solves this problem first earns the block reward and transaction fees, and their block is added to the chain. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs more blocks are built on top of their block, the validity of the transactions now stored on the chain are ratified by other nodes and become very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to alter. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhere can you buy Bitcoin SV (BSV)? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBitcoin SV is listed on major exchanges including OKEx, KuCoin, Huobi, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bithumb  \u2014 as well as dozens of additional platforms. It is also available to purchase from BuyBSV.com. ",

    "description": "Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> that occurs at the predetermined height of block 495,866 and therewith a new chain will be generated as the BCD. Bitcoin Diamond miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call \u201cBitcoin Diamond\u201d.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Diamond coin could win over a lot of Bitcoin users with its faster transaction times, lower fees and easier access to new users. Bitcoin is a hugely popular coin but it can be quite difficult to use! Many critics of Bitcoin argue that the coin won\u2019t be a valid replacement for normal money until users can make small purchases; quickly and easily. A network offering these features will also appeal to small businesses dealing in low priced, high-volume goods like coffee or fast food. However, in my opinion the price of Bitcoin Diamond will have to be more stable before it attracts any big-brand clients like Starbucks or McDonalds.\r\n\r\nOne of the main safety features of blockchain technology is encryption. Private personal information is hidden using computer code. Some critics of Bitcoin think that not enough user information is encrypted. For example, all transactions and their amounts can be seen by anyone using the Bitcoin network. This can make tracing the real identities of users fairly easy for governments and other organizations. The team behind Bitcoin Diamond wanted to encrypt more user information. However, they have recently decided not to add more privacy features to BCD. They feel that governments will soon start passing laws that stop cryptocurrencies from hiding user data. In a statement published on Medium, the team noted Japan and Russia as examples of this trend.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Diamond is processing much larger blocks than Bitcoin in the same amount of time. Larger blocks mean more transactions and a quicker average transaction time. Bitcoin Diamond makes it easy to mine BCD with less powerful computers. GPU mining allows more users to get involved in supporting the network and this can only be a good thing. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency but it\u2019s still quite difficult to use. Diamond coin\u2019s high transaction speeds and low price could make it perfect for buying and selling small and inexpensive products like coffee or bus tickets.",

    "description": "Bitcoin Gold hopes to change the paradigm around mining on the Bitcoin blockchain. According to the founders, the Bitcoin blockchain has become too centralized. Large companies with huge banks of mining computers now mine the vast majority of Bitcoin. For the founders of Bitcoin Gold, having large companies control the Bitcoin network defeats the purpose of a decentralized ledger and peer-to-peer currencies. In response, they\u2019ve initialized the Bitcoin Gold project. It\u2019s an alternate fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that implements changes that make mining more equitable.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Bitcoin Gold is to create a network where anyone can become a miner with only basic hardware. As a result, Bitcoin Gold mining would be spread among many miners, instead of a few large companies.There have several features such as decentralization. Bitcoin Gold decentralizes mining by adopting a PoW algorithm, Equihash-BTG, which cannot be run on the specialty equipment used for Bitcoin mining (ASIC miners.) This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to mine with common GPUs. Besides, there have fair distribution. Hard forking Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain fairly and efficiently distributes 16.5 million BTG immediately to people all over the world who have interest in cryptos. \r\n\r\nOther methods, such as creating coins with a new genesis block, concentrate ownership within a small group. There also have a replay protection. To ensure the safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Gold has implemented full replay protection and unique wallet addresses, essential features that protect users and their coins from several kinds of accidents and malicious threats. Most new mineable cryptocurrencies involve ASIC-resistant hashing algorithms, and it\u2019s becoming something of an industry standard to promote decentralization. In that respect, Bitcoin Gold holds a lot to be excited about. At its core, it\u2019s about transitioning the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> network to more decentralized mining.\r\n\r\nHowever, as we saw above, there\u2019s not much evidence that the current Bitcoin mining system is broken. There have been some small complaints, and it\u2019s not ideal that the network is so centralized. Nevertheless, miners on Bitcoin have a lot to lose if they wield their power too aggressively. There are also new entrants to the Bitcoin mining community that are decentralizing control from a few key ASIC farms. The general consensus from Bitcoin experts is there\u2019s not enough new in Bitcoin Gold to warrant an independent investment. While it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to hold onto your free BTG that you receive as a result of the fork (if you owned Bitcoin before Oct 24), wait until the dust settles before deciding whether to buy more.\"",

This gives them the opportunity to precisely target audiences on a large scale at a much lower cost compared to traditional marketing tools.\r\n\r\nThe Bitcomo affiliate marketing CPA network is wholly performance-based. This means that advertisers pay only when they see results and internet marketers are rewarded for each visitor or customer acquired through their own marketing efforts. This method incentivizes and rewards publishers and advertisers alike.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create an affiliate marketing network which is completely impervious to ad fraud and payout problems. Bitcomo's business model is anchored by blockchain technology and the immutable proof and transparency this provides. This ensures the security of each user's data, whilst simplifying the interactions between them. Blockchain also eliminates unnecessary intermediaries between a company and its target audience. With less steps linking advertisers and their potential clients, companies can invest their advertising budget more wisely and profitably.\r\n\r\nPart of the next generation of CPA networks, Bitcomo is designed to help businesses reduce their advertising costs while increasing their impact. Not only do we know how to use blockchain t echnology to its full potential, but we have developed an infrastructure that will make the process as smooth as possible for businesses. BM Tokens can be spenton an advertising campaign or sold.",

    "description": "BitCore is a cryptocurrency that is a UTXO fork of Bitcoin. Although you hear about hard forks, many people only know about hard Bitcoin forks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold; in contrast, few people know about BitCore or hybrid forks. Using Bitcoin's source code and technology, BitCore created a new blockchain; it made sure that the blockchain size was smaller and scalability was better. In addition, block timings are faster than Bitcoin, making mining ASIC-resistant as well.\r\n\r\nBitCore created a new blockchain on April 24, 2017. It took a snapshot of Bitcoin transaction and created 5 million transactions to fill all public addresses belonging to people who own 0.01 BTC or more. The funding ratio is 0.5 BTX: 1.0 BTC, but if you held bitcoins at the time of the snapshot, then you can apply for your share of BTX at a 1:1 conversion until October 30.\r\n\r\nBitCore is the first cryptocurrency that is a UTXO fork. But it is more than just a hybrid fork. It has tried to improve Bitcoin and solve the problems that plague it. For example, BitCore uses the MEGA-BTX consensus algorithm that is ASIC-resistant. This means that centralization of mining power is not possible, as the playing field is level and everyone has more or less the same opportunities. In addition, BitCore has 10 MB Segwit-enabled blocks that make the network capable of handling 17.6 billion transactions per year or 48 million transactions per day.\r\n\r\nBitCore is a cryptocurrency that promises a lot, especially with the new implementations that have made it algorithm and Masternodes platform, giving the entire crypto community the opportunity to mine BTX with PoW or Masternodes, even BTX holders can mine it with both PoW and Masternodes.",

It was created in 2014 by visionary Dan Larimer (\u201cBytemaster\u201d), co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/steem\">Steemit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a> and Cryptonomex. BitShares is based on Graphene, an open source C++ blockchain implementation, which acts as a consensus mechanism. Graphene is used by several other projects like Steemit.com (decentralized Reddit, blog platform), and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peerplays\">PeerPlays.com</a> (gaming site and token PPY) indicating real-world usage.\r\n\r\nBitShares competes with banks by issuing collateralizing market-pegged and stable bitAssets (also called smart coins). This means crypto-based assets track real-world market assets like the US dollar denominated \u201cbitAsset\u201d known as bitUSD. This tracks the movements of the dollar by aggregating a variety of data sources that are maintained by the BitShares community. This Smart Coin token always has at least 200% (or more) of its value backed by the BitShares core currency (BTS), to which it can be converted at any time, as collateral in a smart-contract based loan managed by the blockchain.\r\n\r\nA SmartCoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to that of another asset, such as the US Dollar or gold. SmartCoins always have 100% or more of their value backed by the BitShares core currency, BTS, to which they can be converted at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price feed. BitShares provides a high-performance decentralized exchange, with all the features you would expect in a trading platform. It can handle the trading volume of the NASDAQ, while settling orders the second you submit them. High performance blockchain technology is necessary for cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms to provide a viable alternative to existing financial platforms.\r\n\r\nBitShares BTS is considered a legacy coin as it predates most exchanges (and publications) and is responsible for the crypto trading pair concept. It\u2019s also the first delegated Proof of Stake blockchain and uses community-elected delegates for governance.",

    "description": "Contrary to common belief, blockchain gaming has little to do with play to earn. It certainly makes it easy to get paid by playing, but at the core blockchain is always - always - about decentralization. As long as you are interacting with a single party, them using blockchain or NFTs is completely superfluous. That may be why blockchain in gaming didn't catch on yet.\r\n\r\nWe are about to change all of that. Our development focuses around decentralizing the gaming industry by moving games from different studios onto the same trustless backend, facilitating NFT and even character exchanges within the same genre. Doing so gives control back to gamers, while at the same time helping Indie developers by creating a strong interconnected fabric of achievement, item & character transfer, with familiar mechanics all wrapped in an SDK that solves the hard problems in game development for them.\r\n\r\nThis will have a profound impact on how games are developed. The focus is going to shift towards story-telling and content creation, while keeping mechanics within the genre mostly uniform and familiar. New powerful items found will add to your character, which is now a truly unique composition of all the games you played in the past. We call this Universal Avatar, which will integrate into the emerging Universal Profile for your identity.",

    "description": "Blockmason is excited to announce the creation of our second blockchain industry revolutionizing product: Blockmason Link!\r\n\r\nAt its core, Link removes the barriers to interact with smart contracts, allowing developers to instantly turn smart contracts on any programmatic blockchain into user-friendly applications. We\u2019ll use Ethereum smart contracts as the example throughout this whitepaper, but Link is main-chain agnostic and is architected in a manner that is adaptable to the leading smart contract supporting main-chains without a native Web API layer. \r\n\r\nLink solves some of the most persistent and pervasive problems plaguing the blockchain community: ease-of-use and accessibility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in the public consciousness, blockchain still primarily functions as a vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and other financial applications.\r\n\r\nAt Blockmason, we are true blockchain believers \u2014 it is only a matter of time until blockchain spurs the healthcare revolution, empowers economic freedom in developing countries, and stabilizes our fragile mass payment systems. However, it is impossible to realize this beautiful crypto-future until the completion of essential components of blockchain infrastructure. \r\n\r\nBlockchain has a high barrier to entry. From a development perspective, it requires learning Solidity, cryptography APIs, and the nuances of esoteric decentralized systems. From a user perspective, the hesitation is even simpler: decentralized applications are too damn tough to use! In a world that increasingly values convenience, it\u2019s difficult to convince people to increase their DApp usage when usage necessitates so many prerequisites, including creating and learning to use an Ethereum wallet, MetaMask, safely storing your private keys, and so on. Just try explaining to someone the long-term benefits of decentralized contracts when even those in charge of regulating new technologies have no idea how they work. All the public thinks is: why use a \u201csmart contract,\u201d when dumb contracts work just fine? Why use Lndr, when I could use Venmo?\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to one of Blockmason\u2019s core beliefs: for an emerging technology to succeed, it must value the user. For too long, the blockchain community has ignored functionality, in favor of niche technical development, finance, or profit \u2014 hindering mass adoption. This is not to say we don\u2019t love nerdy, precise technical advancement (we do!), but rather that we believe a smooth, exciting user experience is a necessary part of technological growth. \r\n\r\nFully realizing the potential of blockchain technology requires the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Mass adoption requires an enhanced user experience, which itself requires technological innovation. Conversely, any technical breakthrough, regardless of its importance, is squandered if it does not solve the user experience. Greater access to technology leads to greater technological advancement. Just think of us as blockchain\u2019s \u201cTyphoid Mary.\u201d\r\n\r\nBlockmason Link \u2014 the missing block in blockchain\u2019s ever growing tower. An innovation that sparks innovation.",

    "description": "Blue Whale Foundation, The Decentralized Ecosystem for the Self-Employed Blue Whale is set to rock the gig economy\u2019s boat by building a decentralized ecosystem to allow freelancers and the self-employed to reap rewards and employment benefits from their contributions\r\n\r\nAgainst the backdrop of technological disruption and offshoring, the \u201cgig/sharing  economy\u201d is burgeoning globally. Freelancers will make up a whopping 58% of the US workforce by 2027. Consequently, peer-to-peer booking platforms like AirBnB and Uber have seen a meteoric rise in demand accompanying these shifts in the job market. As the definition of work changes and evolves, the difficulties encountered by freelancers and part-time workers such as the lack of protection, and the insecurity of self-employment will only worsen. This not only affects the growing mass of freelancers, but also ruptures the social contract between workers and governments. \r\n\r\nConsumer protections have also weakened because of the murky legal relationship between freelancers and their host platforms. This simmering dissatisfaction has created popular backlash, as concerned governments in several countries such as France have begun to crack down on platforms like Uber and AirBnB. Despite these worrying trends, no workable remedy has been proposed - until now. The Blue Whale Foundation\u2019s ICO is set to rock the boat of the gig/sharing economy by leveraging on blockchain as a service to provide freelancers with employment benefits such as paid-time-off, and retirement pensions traditionally available only to salaried employees.",

Each participant of the system can convert the accumulated knowledge and experience into a digital property with the possibility of using it to purchase goods and services in everyday life. An econometric model of the system was developed on the Biznes Molodost audience, the largest business community of Russia and the CIS, which will make it possible to take all the advantages of Blockchain technologies.\r\n\r\nThe implemented functionality will allow thousands of people and entrepreneurs to share their experience, resources, capabilities and knowledge by writing posts, voting and commenting, thus getting a real value expressed in digital tokens of the system, easily convertible into other types of digital property and fiat currencies. Rewards can be received not only by the participants who demonstrate useful activity, but also by those who estimate their contribution.\r\n\r\nThe main idea of the project is to measure, preserve and monetize the value (benefit) that arises in the process of communication between people and is expressed as a change in the reputation coefficient. Keeping the information about communication and monitoring the change in productivity, it is possible to effectively evaluate each participant's potential value for the system and its members, which can be expressed by the reputation coefficient. Reputation is used as the main multiplier determining the size of the reward received by the user from the system and its participants.\r\n\r\nBiznes Molodost community includes thousands of successful entrepreneurs providing a large number of goods and services which are demanded by real people and can be obtained in exchange for BMT tokens. \r\n\r\nAn additional possibility of the BMCHAIN platform  or any business will be the opportunity to create its own Blockchain-application with the necessary logic based on the developed TokenAPI solution without the need to study the technical level of Blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe partner accepting tokens for the payment is offered the automated possibility of conversion of the tokens received into roubles. To accept tokens the system participant must provide users with a list of goods or services including a real discount of at least 20%. The reputation of the partner providing quality products or services in exchange for tokens starts growing along with the bonus tokens credited for the usage of the system and the number of partner's incoming and outgoing transactions. The amount of bonus tokens obtained when making transactions depends on the reputation of the user and the partner.",

    "description": "BNPL Pay is a decentralized lending protocol that puts credit in the hands of those who need it the most, namely, those who cannot meet the requirements to take on collateralized loans. To that end, we have created the BNPL Pay Protocol, an uncollateralized lending platform that services such a need. We tackle the counterparty risk associated with uncollateralized borrowing through a distributed network of Banking Nodes. Our system delegates the tasks of credit checks, risk assessment and other due diligence requirements to pool operators, and creates a set of incentive structures that reward and punish these operators based on performance. \r\n\r\nBanking Nodes manage pools of liquidity, and have the autonomy to delegate these funds to potential borrowers in the parameters they see fit, while lenders can choose an operator that suits their risk-reward preferences to conduct interest bearing activities based on fully transparent data. Borrowers can apply for credit from any or all Bank Nodes, and if approved, are issued loans on fully customizable and agreed upon terms. \r\n\r\nUnlike established protocols within DeFi, uncollateralized borrowing presents an entirely new avenue of risk that is yet to be tackled within blockchain networks, namely, counterparty risk. BNPL Pay seeks to address this risk by delegating the tasks of credit checks, risk assessment and other processes conducted by traditional credit facilities to our node operators. With this, node operators lie at the heart of our protocol, and connect lenders with borrowers. \r\n\r\nThe BNPL token is the governance token within the BNPL Pay protocol and has multiple utility functions including bonding a banking node and staking banking nodes as a form of insurance in the event of a default.",

Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts. Boba offers fast exits backed by community-driven liquidity pools, shrinking the Optimistic Rollup exit period from seven days to only a few minutes, while giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.\r\n\r\nBoba\u2019s extensible smart contracts will enable developers across the Ethereum ecosystem to build dApps that invoke code executed on web-scale infrastructure such as AWS Lambda, making it possible to use algorithms that are either too expensive or impossible to execute on-chain.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re building Boba in a way that puts our users and developers first. Our goal is to build a pragmatic L2 that is the first step towards opening Ethereum to the next Billion users. Join us on our mission and help grow the community.",

    "description": "Blockchains are quickly becoming the modern equivalent of what apps were to smartphones when they took off a decade ago. There\u2019s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\">(Siacoin)</a> to identity verification <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic\">(Civic)</a>. But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\r\n\r\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\r\n\r\nA decentralised banking system was <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin\u2019s</a> original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we\u2019ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.",

The token has been created for crypto investors of all ages and experience levels. The tokenomics of $BINU have been designed to maintain positive trending, known as BULLISH trending, promoting peace of mind and steady long term growth for both seasoned investors, as well as new or novice investors looking to dive deeper into the crypto world with a project and development team they can count on.  \r\n\r\nThis BULLISH trending and steady growth is achieved through the high deflation techniques of $BINU with a tactic we call GRAZING. A high portion of the coin\u2019s utility/tax goes into project marketing. With ample funds for marketing, the team is able to do much more beyond advertising and promoting the project; As new holders FEED and loyal holders REFEED our hungry Bull, the team is also able to help keep our Bull consistently fed through GRAZING. The combined efforts of FEEDING, REFEEDING, and GRAZING is why $BINU will not only yield, but also maintain a BULLISH trend. Beyond the tactics of coin utility and tax, $BINU has discovered the \u201cGoldilocks Zone\u201d for how much is to be taxed; token taxes are low enough to promote new investors as well as holder reinvestment, yet high enough to prohibit 2-3x market manipulators known in the crypto world as \u201cJeets.\u201d This helps the token\u2019s trend to remain BULLISH and reach new ATH\u2019s (All Time Highs) rather than fall into a range of manipulation.",

Buying.com is a next-generation decentralized e-commerce hyper local delivery network, offering  micro distribution channels powered by decentralized delivery networks. We enable smaller retailers who do not have the access to vertically integrated technology and logistic services, to access multiple delivery channels and failure monitoring, and hence, pose a serious threat to larger retailers by offering a fully integrated peer-peer delivery network with a top class delivery service. Our solution offers the most competitive delivery system which can result in 10-30% cost reduction compared to current expenses and expand the business's geographical reach  to help increase its revenue. Current scope of the project focuses on restaurants and food-delivery businesses.\r\n\r\nThe BUY token\u2019s maiden use case is in rewarding loyalty of participating restaurants of it's fulfillment operations in the food service sector where the platform aggregates the orders and deliveries from popular food-ordering apps such as Doordash, GrubHub, Uber Eats, and Postmates. All order details are stored on the Buying.com platform and a final reward calculation is carried out at the end of the day, based on the number of orders. At the end of a month, when the final settlement between the business and Buying.com takes place, the business can redeem the BUY token against their bill. The adjustments will be made  based on the average market price of BUY tokens on the many listed exchanges.\r\n\r\nCurrent reward system, which solely has the number of orders as the contributing metric for reward issuance, will be replaced by a more advanced and improved version, by virtue of a reputation score. Users will be able to rate and review the restaurants, and their services, which will contribute to a restaurant's reputation score. The reward scale will be tilted in favor of restaurants providing better services, incentivising better conduct from the restaurant's end and improving the end consumer's experience.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we intend on accepting the BUY token for placing orders, paying delivery personnels, providing restaurant and end-user rewards etc. New mechanisms are being devised to have \u201cpremium benefits\u201d such as priority deliveries, best rated drivers and cashbacks, based on the amount of BUY tokens staked by the users and restaurants.",

    "description": "What about this description? (tweak if you want): MORE (\ud83d\udfe2) is a decentralized virtual digital currency created by YouTube star, TrVon, Trevon James, that can be sent between users through the Ethereum and Pulse (launching soon) peer-to-peer networks, without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It is the new age of cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography. \r\nThe term \u2018MORE\u2019 can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value). \r\nTrevon James  has shown up time and time again for the past 7 years creating crypto content and sharpening his skills as well as his communities. The one thing MORE community requires is a dedicated and determined leader.  An inspirational juggernaut the community can trust and look to for reassurance and guidance. And who better than to have that role than someone who we know is fully doxed, honest, isn\u2019t going to make empty promises or over sell you on anything.\r\n\r\nMORE has a capped supply of 21million tokens which were all minted at the same time. This means there will never have an unexpected supply shock. MORE is rare by design. \r\n\r\nUnlike the currencies issued by banks and governments, MORE is not vulnerable to losing its value if the centralized issuing authority breaks down. The decentralized system can continue to operate as long as there are members in the network. \r\nThe managing of transactions and the issuing of MORE is carried out collectively by the Ethereum and  Pulse networks.  \r\n TrVon offered MORE airdrops to community members that verified subscriptions to his Patreon and YouTube accounts. He also offered airdrops to member that verified staking HEX in one of Tewkenaire\u2019s smart contacts.",

Mining is available to just about anybody and is highly decentralised. This blockchain functions as the Governance Chain with BXTB as the Governance Token. The BXTB token is comprised of the mined PoC token and an associated ERC20 token that enables the BXTB to be transacted on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nWorking together with this is the CHIP or Yield Token which is an activated BXTB token issued on ERC20 Ethereum that is cryptographically tracked by the BXTB token and generates the actual yield.\r\n\r\nThe BXTB governance token entitles its holders to participate in decisions regarding the ethical and technological direction taken by the foundation and also to help determine important operational factors such as exchange rates, revenue share and technology development.",

Due to absence of miners and blocks, there is no risk of front-running and other miner manipulation, and dApps are safer and easier to develop than blockchain based dApps. DApps are developed in Oscript - a new language that avoids many unsafe programming patterns common in earlier dApp platforms.\r\n\r\nThanks to its safety, Obyte is especially well suited for DeFi apps, some are already available on the platform, such as Discount Stablecoins (https://ostable.org), some are being developed.\r\n\r\nOther features include: self-sovereign identity, private untraceable currencies, sending crypto to email using textcoins, and extremely small-footprint libraries suitable for small IoT devices.",

    "description": "Bytecoin is the first cryptocurrency created with CryptoNote technology. Bytecoin allows users to make absolutely anonymous money transfers through the CryptoNote algorithm. CryptoNote uses CryptoNote ring signatures to provide anonymous transactions and allows you to sign a message on behalf of a group. The signature only proves the message was created by someone from the group, but all the possible signers are indistinguishable from each other.\r\n\r\nEven if outgoing transactions are untraceable, everyone may still be able to see the payments received and thus determine one's income. By using a variation of the Diffie-Hellman exchange protocol, a receiver has multiple unique one-time addresses derived from his single public key. After funds are sent to these addresses they can only be redeemed by the receiver; and it would be impossible to cross-link these payments.\r\n\r\nAs a primarily peer-to-peer (p2p) payment system, Bytecoin has many of the same use-cases as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. Created in 2012, Bytecoin is one of the earliest developed cryptocurrencies. Until recently, the team behind the coin has kept themselves anonymous. Now, though, they\u2019ve opened up multiple communication channels, removed some layers of anonymity, and even built several local communities.\r\n\r\nBitcoin\u2019s PoW consensus algorithm heavily favors miners that use powerful GPU and ASIC machines over those trying to mine with CPUs. This causes the network to centralize around the more powerful miners. Bytecoin attempts to close the gap between these two classes of miners with a new algorithm, Egalitarian Proof-of-Work (PoW). Egalitarian PoW uses a version of skrypt, a proof of work function similar to the hashcash function used by Bitcoin. The difference between the two is that scrypt isn\u2019t memory bound. Because of this, you can produce highly efficient CPU mining rigs. GPUs will always be about 10 times more effective, though.\r\n\r\nThe Bytecoin project has been fairly fractured since its inception in July 2012. Previously, several isolated teams worked on the project without seemingly communicating with each other. This led to numerous forks and versions of the coin. In July 2017, the team decided to change their image and provide more transparency to the community. The team still remains pseudo-anonymous by only providing names and headshots on their webpage \u2013 no bios or social media links. But, it\u2019s tough to expect more from a project that\u2019s focused on privacy. The team has been busy at work refactoring their code and are planning to release a new public API on February 6, 2018. They\u2019ll also be entering the Asian, Middle East, and African markets throughout 2018.",

    "description": "Cardano is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">smart contract platform</a> which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. \r\n\r\nCardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.\r\n\r\nTechnological Innovation\r\nCardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the ground breaking <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof of stake algorithm</a>. The IOHK team employed a \u201cfirst-principles\u201d approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.\r\n\r\nCardano\u2019s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).\r\n\r\nThe protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.\r\n\r\nCardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.\r\n\r\nConceptual Innovation\r\n\r\ni. Privacy and regulation\r\nThe original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must \u2018square the circle\u2019 by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.\r\n\r\nii. Governance\r\nPublic, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks \u2013 in Ethereum's case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.\r\n\r\niii. Funding\r\nThe Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.\r\n\r\nThe Token: ADA Voucher\r\nEvery blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.\r\n\r\nThe Wallet: <a href=\"https://daedaluswallet.io/\">Daedalus</a>\r\nEach cryptocurrency requires a \u201cwallet\u201d to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly-engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/\">IOHK</a> specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic\">Ethereum Classic</a> and many more.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://cardanofoundation.org/en/\">Cardano Foundation</a>\r\nThe Cardano Foundation\u2019s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:\r\n\r\n1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications\r\n2. Be a community hub offering authoritative, timely information about the technology and Cardano\u2019s wide-ranging potential\r\n3. Liaise and influence government and regulatory bodies, form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open source projects and aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for its long term success and critical in adoption and government engagement\r\n\r\nAreas of Focus:\r\n1. Cardano Protocol - We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.\r\n2. Cardano community - We support, grow and help educate the Cardano blockchain community.\r\n3. Cardano ecosystem - We work to expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem. This includes promoting Cardano as a platform for commercial entities and serving as an objective organization for enterprises interested in joining Cardano.\r\n4. Serving the wider blockchain community - We aim to influence and progress the emerging commercial and legislative landscape for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general. We proactively approach government and regulatory bodies and form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open-source projects.\r\n\r\nIOHK\r\nFounded in 2015 by <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a> and <a href=\"https://iohk.io/team/jeremy-wood/\">Jeremy Wood</a>, IOHK is a world-class engineering and technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to three billion people that don\u2019t have them. The group is contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\r\n\r\nEmurgo\r\n<a href=\"https://emurgo.io/\">Emurgo</a> is the venture building entity in the Cardano ecosystem, its goal is to aid, integrate, and foster Cardano blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nEmurgo captures the transformative power that blockchain technology brings to the developing world. Decentralized applications built on Cardano technology, funded and supported by Emurgo, will have the potential to build groundbreaking applications.\r\n\r\nProject Road Map\r\nIOHK has now released the settlement layer. This means you can transact, trade, and purchase Ada tokens fully independently of the computation layer. The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, users will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.\r\nIn 2019, IOHK intends to work on Cardano\u2019s long-term scalability and augment its capabilities. As developers, IOHK has been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being adequately maintained. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem that is capable of funding and supporting itself.",

    "description": "Cardstack is an open-source framework and consensus protocol that makes blockchains usable and scalable for the mass market, creating a decentralized software ecosystem that can challenge today\u2019s digital superpowers. Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee. \r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a \u201ccard\u201d. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\r\n\r\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today\u2019s centralized platforms. It\u2019s an \u201cexperience layer\u201d for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD.",

We have reshaped the old fundraising model by distributing allocation to our community members rather than to close-knit VCs and institutions.\r\n\r\nThe A2DAO (ATD) connects promising crypto projects and retail investors. Holding the ATD allows to get the opportunity to invest in crypto startups, both at an early and public stage. Depending on the type of project, each member of the A2DAO community will have guaranteed allocation based on their current tier level.\r\n\r\nAccelerator program \u2014 A2Jump\r\n\r\nA2Jump acts as a bridge between early-stage blockchain projects and the A2DAO community before a project goes fully public. Accelerator program is an excellent opportunity for early-stage ventures but it also gives ATD holders lucrative investment opportunities.\r\n\r\nEach project that applies to enter the accelerator program will be required to purchase a certain number of tokens in order to pass further audit by our team. When projects receive the status of \u201caccelerator project\u201d they will receive the status of \u201cpartner\u201d and have access to all of our marketing tools.\r\n\r\nChosen projects will receive expertise as part of the A2Jump accelerator program. We believe that the blockchain movement is a fully democratic one and projects that reflect this value deserve to receive the best global expertise and adequate funding.\r\n\r\nThe success of blockchain models applied to solve real-world problems has popularized the technology. In addition, the massive potential of digital assets has caused traditional financial institutions to take notice and the current market rally is largely attributed to an inflow of institutional capital. This has also attracted millions of retail investors and crypto enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nHowever many of these new investors are setting foot into the world of crypto for the first time. They lack the expertise, financial knowledge, and technical capabilities to approach the market with confidence and truly succeed. A2DAO will provide its community investment opportunities with a clear and thorough understanding of each respective project\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nProjects will be rated through the A2DAO voting system and internal audit by founders, team members, and our community. This means that all projects selected by the A2DAO community represent a great opportunity for retail investors, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible without an adequate understanding of core fundamentals.",

    "description": "What is CENNZnet?\r\nCENNZnet is a New Zealand built public blockchain network which powers decentralised applications (DApps) and the crypto currency CENNZ and CPAY. It's a user-first dapp platform which makes blockchain based services accessible for first time builders and end users so that everyone can enjoy the increased network transparency, data privacy and reliability that decentralisation offers.\r\n\r\nHow does CENNZnet work?\r\nThe dual token economy\r\nCENNZnet uses a unique dual token system in order to help developers, users and token holders get the best from the network.\r\nCENNZnet has 2 tokens:\r\nCENNZ - the staking token which works separately to block rewards. This means it can increase in value without impacting the cost of using the network. This is important so the price of CENNZ can continue to increase without impacting the amount developers and users pay to use DApps.\r\nCPAY is the gas in the network and is used to pay transaction fees. It is also a block reward payment in staking. It\u2019s designed to be algorithmically stable, so it will retain a steady value. This means developers creating DApps on the network can easily predict the cost of their application, and stakers can easily predict the value of their stake.\r\n\r\nConsensus mechanism: Proof of Stake\r\nCENNZnet uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This is where node operators hold, or stake, their tokens in a particular wallet as collateral against their promise to perform their duties correctly. If they do perform their duties correctly they receive a reward in our CPAY token. If they do not then the staked tokens are slashed, or fined. Other token holders can also stake their tokens against node operators (validators) of their choosing in order to receive a portion of the CPAY reward.\r\nThis system helps to secure the network by incentivising the community to follow protocol and prevent attacks.\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nCENNZnet functions 100% on-chain using blockchain\u2019s built in voting mechanisms. In CENNZnet governance, validators and node operators are required to vote on proposals using a direct voting mechanism (similar to direct democracy) to achieve consensus. Voting results are governed algorithmically and their automatic execution is built directly into the protocol. The winning decisions then automatically integrated into the chain.\r\nCENNZnet pre-built runtime modules\r\nDApp builders have access to core CENNZnet modules which provide the building blocks to common functions required for DApp users.\r\n\r\nNFT\r\nUsing the CENNZnet NFT module users can mint and sell NFTs on CENNZnet without ever needing to touch a smart contract. Instead, they can create custom NFTs using just a Javascript API or point and click with a UI.\r\n\r\nCENNZX\r\nCENNZX is a spot exchange module which enables a seamless fee payment experience on CENNZnet and makes token exchange instant and easy. The CENNZX Spot eliminates rent extraction and centralised services while prioritising decentralisation, usability and security.\r\n\r\nGeneric Asset\r\nGeneric Asset protocol enables CENNZnet\u2019s multicurrency economy. The module allows transaction fees to be paid in any asset, provided there\u2019s liquidity in the CENNZX in-chain GAS exchange. CENNZX will then seamlessly convert the asset into the official gas token, CPAY. This streamlines onboarding and in-app experience by eliminating the need for new users to learn about different token types and simply opting for their favoured currency.\r\n\r\nDoughnut\r\nThe Doughnut module is the secret sauce of the CENNZnet blockchain. Doughnuts are proofs of delegation between two or more cryptographic keypairs. They allow us to prove that one address delegates something to another address and allows permissions and rules to be carried between different networks without the need for a centralised server. This supports user data privacy whilst maintaining a good user experience.",

Partnership with historians and content creators will be made in order to get quality original. Every $CENT holder will get access to this database and with it, the chance to increase their knowledge on Rome, its culture and language.\r\n\r\nBeneficientia: A percentage from Merchandise, NFTs profits and funds from a dedicated donation section will be used to help museums around the world and also to help building schools where there are none. With this last part we will ensure that while we profit and learn thanks to $CENT, our community can still do some good in the outside world, by spreading opportunities to education and culture and preserving our world heritage.",

Instead of relying on a centralized CDN (Content Delivery Network), Chainflix allows for any individual to contribute their storage to a distributed storage pool. The AI controller will automatically distribute the files to the different storages of the storage pool depending on the file size and traffic of the video. \r\n\r\nFrom the users\u2019 perspective, videos are streamed real time from the individual storages instead of the centralized CDN. Storage providers are also able to receive mining rewards when their storage is selected for the live streaming. By virtually allowing any participant to contribute their spare storage space, Chainflix can significantly reduce the operational costs while rewarding users for their contribution to the ecosystem. Chainflix has 1,750 distributed storages from more than 10 different countries and users from 112 countries. Chainflix has been in development for the past 4 and half years and is providing a beta service live. Chainflix will add live streaming features, video commerce and also users can later use CFXT coins to donate to the other users, purchase items, participate in decentralized governance.",

This novel native node to IPFS communication mechanism allows smart contracts to interact with an updated state of the data in runtime. These advanced features come prebuilt in our core and are accessible on other blockchains through Cherry\u2019s interoperability channels. Decentralized applications built on Cherry or many of the most renowned decentralized networks can now leverage Cherry\u2019s features to augment their dApps. Most of the complexities of building-integrated web3 applications handling data are, thus, abstracted away to the core, allowing smart contract developers to rely on a rich base layer toolkit, and ultimately focus on best serving their customers.",

The project\u2019s suite of services - and native governance token TIME - are hosted on multiple blockchains and include LaborX.com, a peer-to-peer freelancer marketplace, TimeX.io, a Plasma-based cryptocurrency exchange; AUDT, an Australian dollar-backed stablecoin; and PaymentX, a crypto invoicing and payroll solution.\r\n\r\nTIME token\r\nThe TIME token is the native token of the Chrono.tech ecosystem and can be used within its products, e.g. to secure premium account status, as well as staking TIME on TimeWarp.finance to receive the revenues generated by all services. In November 2020, the original TIME token was upgraded to the new ERC677 standard, enabling it to be integrated with other DeFi protocols, allowing lower-cost transactions, and providing other advantages, while remaining fully ERC20-compatible. The new TIME 2.0 token contract also included up-to-date metadata about the project.\r\n\r\nChrono.tech products and ecosystem\r\nChrono.tech aims to solve a series of problems in the global recruitment and employment markets.\r\nLaborX is Chrono.tech\u2019s freelance work portal.

TimeX is a hybrid Plasma-based exchange that offers the benefits of both centralised and decentralised technologies. Use of Plasma allows for fast, secure trading of digital assets. The conventional interface provides a user-friendly trading experience. Based in Australia, TimeX is licensed and compliant with rules and best practices required by AUSTRAC, the country\u2019s financial intelligence agency. TimeX is listed on CoinMarketCap https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/timex/\r\nTimeWarp is the ecosystem\u2019s DeFi yield farming application where TIME holders can stake their token to earn revenues generated by all products of the Chrono.tech product range. All 100% of revenues generated are being distributed to TIME holders on a weekly basis.\r\nAUDT is a stablecoin, hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and backed 1:1 with Australian dollars (AUD). Use of AUDT enables traders to move money into and out of the blockchain ecosystem from an Australian bank account, to store value in AUD on the blockchain and transfer funds anywhere in the world, quickly and easily. AUDT is one of the key fiat currencies traded on TimeX. AUDT is fully compliant with AUSTRAC requirements and undergoes regular audits conducted by a licensed, third party accounting firm.\r\nPaymentX is a multi-currency crypto payroll solution that enables individuals as well as businesses to integrate crypto payments into their day-to-day invoice processes.

Companies can pay multiple invoices with one click, while the software converts the dollar-equivalent amount due into crypto automatically at the point of transaction, avoiding the need for manual calculations.\r\nTimeBridge is an in-house developed multi-blockchain tokenbridge that supports multiple blockchains such as Ethereum and BSC. It allows transferring of TIME tokens between networks.\r\n",

But if it were too high, then the tax that the CEO has to pay (0.1% of the amount X) would be too high and the deposit that the previous CEO had to put initially would run out faster. There is the game equilibrium.\r\nThe \"CEO of Cryptopunks\" can write a Graffiti message in the web so that everybody can see it. They can also change the emission rate of $CIG by 20% each time, with a cooldown time of 2 epochs. It starts from 1000 $CIG emmitted per block, which is the maximum, and there is also a minimum emmision rate. The $CIG are emmitted to the LPers of the CIG-WETH pair in Sushiswap in a linearly proportional way, just as in any other liquidity mining program.\r\n\r\nIt can also be considered a Christmas airdrop to the PUNK community, where each PUNK holder is gifted with 100k CIG per PUNK they hold. It is similar in spirit to the style of the $SOS token, but focused on the more specific PUNK community. Hopefully, the PUNK community revolves around it with time and may use it for a wider variety of purposes, like a more advanced game or a DAO. Due to the decentralized nature of the project, it is not possible yet to determine how will it evolve.",

Real estate token allows the community to diversify their portfolio on-chain to generate stable yield through real-world assets that have constant liquidity through AMM. We are building a platform that creates easier, borderless, transparent, and scalable access to real estate for the community. By tokenizing and transacting real estate on-chain, we aim to solve the lack of liquidity, access limitation, and lack of composability plaguing the existing real estate universe. With DeFi gaining popularity over the past years, the ecosystem needs alternative sources of yield generation beyond lending protocols and trading fees.

CloudCoin is not assembled on blockchain, and therefore has no record of all transactions sent and received.  It can be stored online or offline in a wallet, in a JPEG, PDF, Stack File, and can be transferred via email, SMS, Cloud-transfer, or even on paper.\r\n\r\nCloudCoin is a theoretically \u201cperfect\u201d global currency that is tamper-proof, fraud-proof, and recoverable if lost or stolen.  CloudCoin is quantum-safe.  Each CloudCoin consists of 3,200 bits of secret data that changes when the coin is transferred, so that no CloudCoins may be double-spent.\r\n\r\nWith a starting fixed supply of 16,777,216 coins, CloudCoin is scalable as the value grows.  The RAIDA Admins have the authority to vote to split coins (like stocks), creating a copy of all coins, belonging to the owners of each coin to ensure equal distribution, with new coins receiving a new serial number.  This exists in order to sustain a sensible denomination for real-world transactions.  There is no inflation to the supply, and no deflation to the supply.  CloudCoin is intended to be the first digital currency that is able to be used as real-world money.\r\n\r\nCloudCoin is environmentally-friendly, and the entire network runs on the equivalent electrical consumption of a handful of Tesla Superchargers.",

    "description": "What Is Coin ($COIN)?\r\n\r\nCoin is a digital decentralized network composed of protocols, smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and services that help facilitate the transfer of value across the Internet. Coin creates an open financial system made up of decentralized solutions that empower consumers to execute financial transactions with freedom and ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Up the Coin Ecosystem?\r\n\r\nToken\r\n\r\nThe Coin Ecosystem is powered by the $COIN token, a digital asset and network access token that enables holders to execute Coin smart contracts, stake interest, and execute governance rights. $COIN also represents a stake in the Coin protocol and is the voting currency for all proposed protocol and platform changes by the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nWallet\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet is an all-in-one decentralized cryptocurrency wallet, exchange, and AI assistant. Coin Wallet includes a native cryptocurrency wallet and exchange for users to store and swap popular digital assets directly with each other. Unlike many other decentralized exchanges, swaps can occur cross-chain across different blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, and more. \r\n\r\nCoin Wallet is non-custodial, lives in a browser extension, and is non-susceptible to hacks as users are the only people that have and can access their funds. For exchanging assets, Coin Wallet uses atomic swap technology to handle direct peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions across different blockchains.\r\n\r\nCoin's integrated artificial intelligence (AI) assistant transforms the traditional financial experience by highlighting and providing insights for blockchain-specific keywords on any web page. Additionally, the Coin AI enables users to execute transactions by simply typing a command in any input field.\r\n\r\nThe combination of decentralized P2P technology, cross-chain interoperability, and AI integration, creates a secure and unparalleled experience to help consumers easily manage their digital assets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwap\r\n\r\nCoin Swap is a P2P cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) that is compatible with any Internet web browser. It utilizes the same atomic swap technology in the Coin Wallet excluding a native wallet and the Coin AI assistant \u2014 this enables users to connect their favorite Web3 cryptocurrency wallet (including Coin Wallet) without the need to install a browser extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders and Advisors of Coin?\r\n\r\nCoin is assembled from a diverse and experienced team of technology veterans spanning the information technology, financial, and blockchain industries.\r\n\r\nFounder and CEO Damon Nam is formerly an accomplished 17-year IT services professional at Microsoft. He held multiple management roles for the largest software company in the world and in his last role, was responsible for a $90M book of business as a Partner Program Director for Microsoft North America.\r\n\r\nCTO Byron Levels is an experienced 20-plus-year technologist who has worked for many Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Pepsi, and American Airlines to name a few. He has a strong background in developing and deploying enterprise applications.\r\n\r\nCoin is supported by a team of advisors who are the pioneers in AI and blockchain. They include founder and CEO of FetchyFox Christina Apatow, founder and CEO of Celsius Network and investor of VoIP Alex Mashinsky, and co-founder of the Augur prediction market and Ausum Ventures, Jeremy Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Coin Unique?\r\n\r\nNative cross-chain interoperability\r\n\r\nNo more wrapped tokens. No more sending to multiple exchanges to swap tokens.\r\n\r\nUnlike many industry leading decentralized exchanges, one of the unique features of the Coin network is swapping directly between different blockchains. The Coin network leverages atomic swap technology and Hash Time Lock Contracts to handle direct peer-to-peer trustless transactions. This removes the need for custodians, middlemen, and escrow agents. Coin Wallet and Coin Swap supports popular digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC20 supported tokens, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn AI assistant providing insights\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet includes browser extension support for popular web browsers such as Google Chrome.\r\n\r\nWhen installed, the browser extension extends its capability by using AI technology to execute transactions faster and provide insights to help users save time and money. By recognizing finance and blockchain-related keywords from any webpage, the AI assistant can provide education, pricing information, or help consumers execute financial transactions directly from any webpage with an input field.\r\n\r\n\r\nConversational-level experience\r\n\r\nUsability and ease-of-use remain a significant barrier-to-entry and problem for many consumers in the blockchain industry.\r\n\r\nCoin Wallet and Coin Swap uses natural language processing technology to recognize intent while helping users navigate through their financial journey. Coin also leverages this technology for alternate input sources such as text (messaging apps) and voice (digital assistants).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many Coin ($COIN) Tokens are Available and In Circulation?\r\n\r\n$COIN has a maximum supply of 100M tokens. Approximately 49M of the tokens are circulating with the remainder of those tokens distributed in the network\u2019s staking reserve and Uniswap liquidity pool.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Can You Buy Coin ($COIN)?\r\n\r\nAs of December 2020, Coin ($COIN) can be traded at Uniswap.\r\n",
